# Writing the Query Results into Google SpreadSheet

This article explains how to write job results to your Google SpreadSheet.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including [the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com).
  * Account of Google Docs

## Basic Usage

### For On-demand Jobs

For on-demand jobs, just add the `-r` option to the `td query` command. After the job is finished, the results are written into your `output_table` within `testdb` database.

    :::sql
    $ td query
      -r 'gspreadsheet://user:password@domain.com/spreadsheet_name/worksheet_name' \
      -w -d testdb \
      "SELECT v['code'] AS code, COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access GROUP BY v['code']"

The example URL string is like followings.

    :::text
    Gmail
    gspreadsheet://kazuki.ohta:password@gmail.com/TDTest/Sheet1
    
    Google Apps
    gspreadsheet://kazuki.ohta:password@treasure-data.com/TDTest/Sheet1

Here is the screenshot of the result.

### For Scheduled Jobs

For scheduled jobs, just add the `-r` option when scheduling a job. Every time the job runs, the results are written into `mytbl`.

    :::term
    $ td result:create mygss td://user:password@domain.com/spreadsheet_name
    $ td sched:create hourly_count_example "0 * * * *" \
      -d testdb \
      -r mygss:worksheet_name \
      "SELECT v['code'] AS code, COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access GROUP BY v['code']"
