#Streaming Twitter Data into Treasure Data from Node.js

##Introduction

Node.js is an increasingly popular server-side implementation of JavaScript. In this article, we show how to stream Twitter Data into Treasure Data from Node.js via td-agent.

NOTE: We have <a href="nodejs">another article</a> that covers using Treasure Data from Node.js in general.

##Prerequisites

* [Sign up](https://www.treasure-data.com/signup/) for Treasure Data and go through the [quickstart](quickstart) if you haven't done so yet.
* Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.
* You need to install td-agent (packaged version of [fluentd](http://fluentd.org)). [See here for how to install td-agent](td-agent)

##Configuring td-agent

At this point, you should have td-command (`td`) installed on your machine ([You can download td-command from the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com) page). Also, you should have td-agent set up.

Now, let's configure td-agent to listen to port 24224 (This port number is arbitrary. But later code assumes this is the case). Open the td-agent configuration file (most likely in '/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf') and edit it as follows:

	<match td.*.*>
	  apikey YOUR_API_KEY
	  ...
	<source>
	  type forward
	  port 24224
	  ...

You can look up `YOUR_API_KEY` via td-command with `td apikey:show`.

##Getting ntwitter + fluent-logger-node

You need two Node.js libraries: [ntwitter](https://github.com/AvianFlu/ntwitter) to grab tweets from Twitter's Stream API and [fluent-logger-node](https://github.com/yssk22/fluent-logger-node) to send data to td-agent/fluentd.

Here is what `package.json` should look like:

	:::javascript
	{
	  "name": "sample-app",
	  "version": "0.0.1",
	  "private": true,
	  "dependencies": {
	    "ntwitter": "~0.5.0",
	    "fluent-logger": "~0.1.0"
	  }
	}

All you need to do now is run `npm install`.

##Streaming Tweets into Treasure Data

Here is the code that searches for the keyword `javascript` on Twitter, grabs tweets, and streams them onto Treasure Data.

	:::javascript
	/*jslint indent: 4*/
	/*jslint node: true */
	'use strict';

	var Twitter = require('ntwitter'),
	    logger = require('fluent-logger');
	
	// Configure the logger to post data to localhost:24224
	// The "td.test_db" tag tells td-agent to store data in a database named "test_db". 
	logger.configure('td.test_db', {host: 'localhost', port: 24224});

	var twit = new Twitter({
	    consumer_key: 'XXX',
	    consumer_secret: 'XXX',
	    access_token_key: 'XXX',
	    access_token_secret: 'XXX',
	});

	// Tracking the keyword 'javascript'
	twit.stream('statuses/filter', {'track': 'javascript'}, function (stream) {
	    stream.on('data', function (data) {
	    		// Sending the data to a table named "javascript"
	        logger.emit('javascript', data);
	    });
	});

For consumer_key/consumer_secret/access_token_key/access_token_secret, please use your own.

**That's it!** Soon, you start seeing data populated on Treasure Data. You can see your data either via command-line (ex: `td tables`) or a [browser console](https://console.treasure-data.com).

Here is an example query that returns the top 20 most retweeted Tweets:

	$ td query -w -d test_db '
		SELECT
			get_json_object(v["user"], "$.screen_name"),
			v["text"],
			v["retweet_count"] AS retweet_count
		FROM javascript
		ORDER BY retweet_count DESC
		LIMIT 20'
