# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some questions frequently asked by our users.

## How can I write out query results into X? (ex: How can I write query results into MySQL?)

Treasure Data provides the ability to write query results into various datastores such as Treasure Data, MySQL and PostgreSQL. The list of currently supported output options can be found [here](/categories/result).

## It looks like Treasure Data uses Hive. Does this mean I have to worry about schema changes?

Treasure Data supports HiveQL semantics, but unlike Apache Hive, we allow the user to set and modify the schema at any time. We do not require table schema to be defined upfront. For more information, please refer to [this document](/articles/schema).

## How can I handle nested JSON records?

Nested JSON records can be parsed by using the [get_json_object UDF](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF) command with HiveQL. However, we recommend that you maintain a flat JSON structure since this command is a source of additional performance overhead.

## How can I use the td command through a proxy?

Please set the HTTP_PROXY variable (e.g. export HTTP_PROXY="proxy_host:8080"). This is supported from td v0.10.41.

## Hive's reserved keywords (Why do I get a warning about reserved keywords?)

Treasure Data uses Hive as a querying language. One of Hive's limitations is that a table name cannot be a reserved keyword. Thus, if your table (or database) name is among the list of reserved keywords, you won't be able to query data in that table (or database).

For example if you create an `'items'` table and store data in it, you won't be able to execute the following hive query, because `'items'` is a reserved keyword in Hive.

    :::sql
    SELECT v FROM items

The following are reserved keywords in Hive:

    :::sql
    TRUE, FALSE, ALL, AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, ASC, DESC, ORDER, BY, GROUP, WHERE, FROM, AS, SELECT, DISTINCT, INSERT, OVERWRITE, OUTER, JOIN, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, ON, PARTITION, PARTITIONS, TABLE, TABLES, TBLPROPERTIES, SHOW, MSCK, DIRECTORY, LOCAL, TRANSFORM, USING, CLUSTER, DISTRIBUTE, SORT, UNION, LOAD, DATA, INPATH, IS, NULL, CREATE, EXTERNAL, ALTER, DESCRIBE, DROP, REANME, TO, COMMENT, BOOLEAN, TINYINT, SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, STRING, BINARY, ARRAY, MAP, REDUCE, PARTITIONED, CLUSTERED, SORTED, INTO, BUCKETS, ROW, FORMAT, DELIMITED, FIELDS, TERMINATED, COLLECTION, ITEMS, KEYS, LINES, STORED, SEQUENCEFILE, TEXTFILE, INPUTFORMAT, OUTPUTFORMAT, LOCATION, TABLESAMPLE, BUCKET, OUT, OF, CAST, ADD, REPLACE, COLUMNS, RLIKE, REGEXP, TEMPORARY, FUNCTION, EXPLAIN, EXTENDED, SERDE, WITH, SERDEPROPERTIES, LIMIT, SET, TBLPROPERTIES
