# Frequently Asked Questions

This document collects frequently asked questions.

1. How can I write out query results into X? (ex: How can I write query results into MongoDB?)
    Treasure Data provides the ability to write query results into various datastores such as Treasure Data, MySQL and PostgreSQL. Please [check out the status of various options here](/categories/result).

2. It looks like Treasure Data uses Hive? Does this mean I have to worry about schema change?
    Treasure Data supports HiveQL semantics, but unlike Apache Hive, we do not require table schema to be defined upfront and allow the customer to set and modify schema anytime. [Please see this document for more information](/articles/schema).
