# Frequently Asked Questions

This document collects frequently asked questions.

## How can I write out query results into X? (ex: How can I write query results into MySQL?)

Treasure Data provides the ability to write query results into various datastores such as Treasure Data, MySQL and PostgreSQL. Please [check out the status of various options here](/categories/result).

## It looks like Treasure Data uses Hive? Does this mean I have to worry about schema change?

Treasure Data supports HiveQL semantics, but unlike Apache Hive, we do not require table schema to be defined upfront and allow the customer to set and modify schema anytime. [Please see this document for more information](/articles/schema).

## How can I handle nested JSON records?

Using [get_json_object UDF](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF) with HiveQL, the nested JSON records are able to be parsed. But it has additional performance overhead, so having flat JSON structure is recommended on our platform.

## How can I use proxy for td command?

Please set the HTTP_PROXY variable like export HTTP_PROXY="proxy_host:8080". This is supported from td v0.10.41.
