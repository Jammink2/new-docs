# Frequently Asked Questions

This document collects frequently asked questions.

## How can I write out query results into X? (ex: How can I write query results into MySQL?)

Treasure Data provides the ability to write query results into various datastores such as Treasure Data, MySQL and PostgreSQL. The list of currently supported output options can be found [here](/categories/result).

## It looks like Treasure Data uses Hive. Does this mean I have to worry about schema changes?

Treasure Data supports HiveQL semantics, but unlike Apache Hive, we allow the user to set and modify the schema at any time. We do not require table schema to be defined upfront. For more information, please refer to [this document](/articles/schema).

## How can I handle nested JSON records?

Nested JSON records can be parsed by using the [get_json_object UDF](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF) command with HiveQL. However, we recommend that you maintain a flat JSON structure since this command is a source of additional performance overhead.

## How can I use the td command through a proxy?

Please set the HTTP_PROXY variable (e.g. export HTTP_PROXY="proxy_host:8080"). This is supported from td v0.10.41.
