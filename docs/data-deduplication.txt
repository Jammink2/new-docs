# Data De-duplication for Treasure Agent

Treasure Data supports data de-duplication via the following mechanism.

1. [Treasure Agent](td-agent) assigns a universally unique identifier (UUID) to each chunk of data.
2. Treasure Agent retries whenever it detects network failure. However, this can sometimes result in the same chunk of data being sent more that once.
3. When a chunk arrives, Treasure Data's API endpoint inspects the chunk's ID and discards it if it's been processed in the last 10 minutes to avoid data duplication.
