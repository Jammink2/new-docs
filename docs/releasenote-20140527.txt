# Release Note 20140527

## Features & Improvements

This is a summary of the new features and improvements introduced in this release:

### Console: Import Data Design Improvements

Improved the Design of both the landing pages for SDK and SaaS import methods: the existing SDKs are highlighted while the other options are transformed to more intuitive checkboxes instead of a multi-selection list.

### Console: Import Data after the Tutorial

At the end of the tutorial offered when creating a new account or voluntarily executed by an existing user from the [Quickstart](https://console.treasuredata.com/start) page, the user is solicited to try and import his/her own data into the Service.

## Bug Fixes

This is the only important Bug Fix made in this release:

### Backend: Bulk Import conflict

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Query Result Output to S3 in TSV format does not work.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  This was due to an inconsistent handling of the Result Output to S3 optional parameters provided by the CLI - the options were ignored.<br/>
