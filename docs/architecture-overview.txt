Architecture Overview
=====================

## Overview

Treasure Data is a **Cloud Data Warehousing Service**, based on our own extensions of *Apache Hadoop*. Import your data instantly, and process them by issueing a SQL-style query which runs in parallel on the cloud.

Focus 100% on your data analytics, and never worry about server scaling, storages and infrastructure ever again.

## Why We Started Our Business?

The importance of data analytics and warehousing has been increasing, but most existing solutions are still a luxury only to large business. To take advantage of emerging data management and analytics technologies based on open source software, we are to democratize them.

## Problems

The data deluge is now the common problem across all industries becaulse of the rise of smart phones, social medias, sensor devices, etc. Many companies are now trying to convert their data into valuable insights, but handling huge amount of data is a challenge for any businesses.

This problem is known as*Big Data Problem*, and it mostly comes from:

* **Human** problem: strong data engineers are the scarce resource.
* **Economic** problem: the existing data warehouse is extremely expensive.
* **Architectural** problem: the existing infrastructure is hard to change.

Our service aims to solve all of those problems.

## What We Provide

We're providing **Cloud-based Data Warehousing** service. You can store, manage, and process large amount of data by taking advantages of cloud technologies. The major advantages are:

* **Instant** setup, with a pay-as-you-go model.
* **Elastic** resource allocation, means scaling up and down at anytime.
* **Infinite** cloud storage capacity, with high availability.
* **Cost** of cloud storage is extremely cheap, compared to the existing solution.

And the key features are...

### Built-in Data Collector

Treasure Data provides *[td-agent](/articles/td-agent)*, a data collection daemon. It should be installed within your existing infrastructure, and collects records from various data sources, and continuously uploads them to Treasure Data.

### Cloud Storage

All the data is stored on a cloud storage, with columnar data representation. This achieves a lot more performance and compression rate, compared to the existing RDBMSs. And of course, *your data is yours*. You can bulk-export your data at any time.

### SQL-Style Query with Parallel Execution

A SQL-style language let you analyze the stored data. The query is automatically executed in parallel at the cloud-hosted Hadoop cluster, so the users are able to handle large datasets without having to learn anything new. Also, our engine is schema-free. You can modify your data schema at any time.

### Curation and Support

We actively curate each layer, ensuring you have the latest in software (e.g. Apache Hadoop) and best practices, and that it's all stable and integrated smoothly. The dedicated support team is organized to help the users.
