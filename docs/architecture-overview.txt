Architecture Overview
=====================

## Overview

Treasure Data is a **Big Data as-a-Service**, based on *Apache Hadoop*. Import your data instantly, and process them by issueing a SQL-style query which runs in parallel on the cloud.

<br />

Focus 100% on your data analytics, and never worry about server scaling, storages and infrastructure ever again.

## Why We Started Our Business?

Despite the increasing importance of data warehousing and analytics, most solutions today remain luxuries available only to large businesses. We strive to bring data management and analytics to the masses by leveraging open source software. 

## Problems

Overabundance of data is now a common problem across all industries, due to the proliferation of smart phones, social media, and sensors. Businesses today are trying to find valuable insights from their data. However, managing very large amounts of data has proven to be a challenge for many companies.

This is known as the *Big Data Problem*:

* **Resource** Problem: Strong data engineers are in high demand.
* **Economic** Problem: Existing data warehouses are expensive. The operational overhead to manage large-scale clusters is a major concern for management.
* **Architectural** Problem: Changing the existing infrastructure is difficult.

Our service is designed to solve these problems.

## What We Provide

We provide a **Cloud-based Data Warehousing** service. You can store, manage, and process large amounts of data by leveraging the advantages of cloud technologies. The major advantages are:

</a>

* **Instant** setup.
* **Infinite** cloud storage capacity, with high availability.
* **Easy** to use, and does not require deep knowledge of "Big Data" technologies. You focus on your data instead of cluster management.
* **Elastic** resource allocation that can be scaled up or down anytime.
* **Connectivity** to your existing data sources and analytics applications without architectual changes.
* **Costs** for cloud storage are signficantly lower than traditional data warehousing solutions. Our monthly subscription model lowers initial investment requirements.

Key features include:

### 1) Built-in Data Collector

Treasure Data provides a data collection daemon, *[td-agent](/articles/td-agent)*, which is installed in your existing infrastructure. td-agent collects records from various data sources and continuously uploads the data to Treasure Data's cloud storage.

### 2) Cloud Columnar Storage

All your data is stored in the cloud as a columnar data. This format achieves far better performance and compression compared to existing RDBMSs. We also believe that *your data is yours*: you can bulk-export your data at any time.

### 3) SQL-Style Query with Parallel Execution

Treasure Data lets you analyze your data using a SQL-style language. The query is automatically executed in parallel at the cloud-hosted Hadoop cluster, so the users are able to handle large datasets without having to learn anything new. Also, our engine is schema-free. You can modify your data schema at any time.

### 4) Export to RDBMS/Traditional Warehouse

[A built-in export capability](/categories/result) is provided for writing summarized data from the Treasure Data store to a traditional RDBMs or Data Warehouse. This enables efficient processing of large data volumes with Treasure Data both as a primary analytics engine as well as a preprocessing platform.

### 5) JDBC interface to BI tools

Treasure Data also provides a standard [JDBC interface](jdbc-driver) for data transfer to existing (or future) BI tools. Custom coding and maintenance to link these environments with the primary data store is eliminated.

### 6) Curation and Support

We actively curate each piece of technology we use. We ensure that you have the latest in software (e.g. Apache Hadoop) and best practices, and that it's all stable and integrated smoothly. Our support team is dedicated to helping our users.
