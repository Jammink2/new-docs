Architecture Overview
=====================

Treasure Data is the cloud data warehousing service. Import your data instantly, and process them throw a SQL-style query which runs in parallel on the cloud. Never think about servers, storages, and infrastructure.

### Multi-Tenant

Treasure Data is a multi-tenant platform and hosting environment. You don’t need your own servers, storages, or clusters, and you’ll benefit from continuous platform improvements.

### Fully Managed

Because we control all the infrastructure and software layers, we can present a clean interface for managing your data.

### Curation

We actively curate each layer, ensuring you have the latest in software (e.g. Apache Hadoop) and best practices, and that it's all stable and integrated smoothly.
