Architecture Overview
=====================

## Overview

Treasure Data is a **Cloud Data Warehousing Service**, based on our own extensions of *Apache Hadoop*. Import your data instantly, and process them by issueing a SQL-style query which runs in parallel on the cloud.

<br />

Focus 100% on your data analytics, and never worry about server scaling, storages and infrastructure ever again.

## Why We Started Our Business?

The importance of data analytics and warehousing has been increasing, but most existing solutions are still a luxury only to large business. To take advantage of emerging data management and analytics technologies based on open source software, we are to democratize them.

## Problems

The data deluge is now a common problem across all industries beccause of the rise of smart phones, social medias and sensor devices. Many businesses try to find out valuable insights from such data, but handling large-scale data is always challenging.

This problem is known as *Big Data Problem*, mostly coming from:

* **Resource** problem: strong data engineers are the scarce resource.
* **Economic** problem: the existing data warehouse is expensive, and operational overhead to manage large-scale clusters is a major concern for managements.
* **Architectural** problem: the existing infrastructure is hard to change.

We designed our service solve those problems.

## What We Provide

We're providing **Cloud-based Data Warehousing** service. You can store, manage, and process large amount of data by taking advantages of cloud technologies. The major advantages are:

</a>

* **Instant** setup, with a monthly subscription model.
* **Infinite** cloud storage capacity, with high availability.
* **Easy** to use, without deep knowledge of "Big Data" technologies. Just focus on your data, not a cluster management.
* **Elastic** resource allocation, means scaling up and down at anytime.
* **Connectivity** You can adopt it to your data sources and analytics applications without architectual changes.
* **Cost** of cloud storage is extremely inexpensive, compared to existing data warehousing solutions.

And the key features are:

### 1) Built-in Data Collector

Treasure Data provides *[td-agent](/articles/td-agent)*, a data collection daemon. It will be installed in your existing infrastructure, collects records from various data sources, and continuously uploads them to Treasure Data.

### 2) Cloud Columnar Storage

All data is stored in the cloud storage, as a columnar data representation. This achieves far better performance and compression rate, compared to the existing RDBMSs. And of course, *your data is yours*. You can bulk-export your data at any time.

### 3) SQL-Style Query with Parallel Execution

A SQL-style language lets you analyze your data. The query is automatically executed in parallel at the cloud-hosted Hadoop cluster, so the users are able to handle large datasets without having to learn anything new. Also, our engine is schema-free. You can modify your data schema at any time.

### 4)Export to RDBMS/Traditional Warehouse

[A built-in export capability](/categories/result) is provided for writing summerized data from the Treasure Data store to a traditional RDBMs or Data Warehouse. This enables efficient processing of large data volumes with Treasure Data both as a primary analytics engine as well as a pre-process- ing platform.

### 5) JDBC interface to BI tools

Treasure Data also provides a standard [JDBC interface](jdbc-driver) for data transfer to existing (or future) BI tools. Custom coding and maintenance to link these environments with the primary data store is eliminated.

### 6) Curation and Support

We actively curate each layer, ensuring you have the latest in software (e.g. Apache Hadoop) and best practices, and that it's all stable and integrated smoothly. The dedicated support team is organized to help our users.

## Use Cases
