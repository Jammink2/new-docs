Architecture Overview
=====================

## Overview

Treasure Data is a **Cloud Data Warehousing Service**, based on our own extensions of *Apache Hadoop*. Import your data instantly, and process them by issueing a SQL-style query which runs in parallel on the cloud. Focus 100% on your data analytics, and never worry about server scaling, storages and infrastructure ever again.

The users automatically gain the advantages of the cloud, since the platform itself is built on top of a cloud infrastructure.

* The computing resources can be allocated **INSTANTLY**, with pay as we go model.
* The computing resources can be **ELASTIC**, scale up and down at anytime.
* The cloud storage capacity is nearly **INFINITE**.
* The cloud storage is arguably the most **ECONOMICAL** form of storing data.

### 1) Installing td-agent

Treasure Data provides td-agent, a data collection daemon. It collects or receives logs from various data sources, and uploads to Treasure Data.

### 2) Issueing SQL-style Query

Treasure Data also allows us to access and analyze our data through a SQL-style language used in standard RDBMSs (example: Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL), and even having 

We can harness the power of Hadoop and cloud computing. We will now be able to handle large datasets without having to learn anything new.

## Key Architectural Benefits

### Instant & Elastic

You can get an instant access to your data warehouse just after the signup. You can scale up and down your data warehousing capability (CPU power and storage capacity), at any moment.

### Multi-Tenant

Treasure Data is a multi-tenant data warehousing platform. You don’t need your own servers, storages, or clusters, and you’ll benefit from continuous platform improvements.

### Fully Managed

Because we control all the infrastructure and software layers, we can present a clean interface for managing your data.

### Curation

We actively curate each layer, ensuring you have the latest in software (e.g. Apache Hadoop) and best practices, and that it's all stable and integrated smoothly.
