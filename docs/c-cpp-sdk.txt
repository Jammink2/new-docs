# C/C++ Data Import with Fluent Bit

This article describes how to import the data reliably from your C/C++ applications, using [Fluent Bit](http://fluentbit.io/).

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of C/C++ Application Development.
  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data.

## What is Fluent Bit?

Fluent Bit is a specialized open-source data collector tool for embedded operating systems and is developed by Treasure Data. Fluent Bit have been designed and built to be used not just as a standalone tool, it can also be embedded in your C or C++ applications.

By emdedding Fluent Bit into your C/C++ applications, you can have robust yet light-weight data collection mechanism (buffering, retry, etc) inside your applications.

## How to Embed Fluent Bit?

### Step-1: Prepare Configuration File

First, please prepare your configuration file. Please retrieve your Write-Only API key from [here](https://console.treasuredata.com/users/current), and then please specify the destination database and table name.

    # Treasure Data Output
    # ===================
    # This configuration file specifies the information to be used
    # when flushing information to TreasureData.com service. All
    # key fields in the 'TD' section are mandatory.
    [TD]
        # API
        # ===
        # The TreasureData API key. To obtain this please log into your
        # TreasureData Console:
        #
        # 1. Go to https://console.treasuredata.com/users/current
        # 2. API Keys box: copy the API key hash
        API YOUR_WRITE_ONLY_API_KEY
    
        # Database
        # ========
        # Specify the name of your database, it must exists.
        Database db_example
    
        # Table
        # =====
        # Specify the database table name where the records will be stored
        Table    table_example

An example configuration is available [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/blob/master/conf/td_output.conf).

### Step-2: Embed libfluent-bit into your Applications

First, please obtain the entire source code from GitHub.

- [https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit)

When Fluent Bit is built, it creates the final binary and a shared library version called libfluent-bit.so which can be linked in your projects. The library allows you to enqueue data into the engine and return as quickly as possible. All the hard work is done in one posix thread that works in an asynchronous mode and your caller process or thread will not be blocked.

Here's an example program to send the data to Treasure Data.

    :::c
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <fluent-bit.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        int i;
        int n;
        int ret;
        char tmp[256];
        struct flb_config *config;
    
        if (argc < 2) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Usage: td /path/to/configuration.file\n");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    
        /* Create configuration context */
        config = flb_config_init();
        if (!config) {
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    
        /* Enable verbose messages */
        flb_config_verbose(FLB_TRUE);
    
        /* Load a configuration file (required by TD output plugin) */
        ret = flb_lib_config_file(config, argv[1]);
    
        /* Initialize library */
        ret = flb_lib_init(config, (char *) "td");
        if (ret != 0) {
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
    
        /* Start the background worker */
        flb_lib_start(config);
    
        /* Push some data */
        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            n = snprintf(tmp, sizeof(tmp) - 1, "{\"key\": \"val %i\"}", i);
            flb_lib_push(config, tmp, n);
        }
        
        flb_lib_stop(config);
        return 0;
    }

As you can see, we only need to include the fluent-bit.h header and use the functions in the right order. The description of each function is available here:
