## Wish: Facebook App with Millions of Active Users

Our flagship product, [Wish](http://www.wishwall.me) improves online merchandise discovery by letting users discover and share cool products and get rewards.

We launched Wish in November 2011, and I am pleased to see that we have millions of registered users already, [making it one of the top 150 Facebook applications worldwide.](http://www.appdata.com/leaderboard/apps?fanbase=0&genre_id=Select+category&language_id=Select+language&list_select=apps&metric_select=mau&page=6&platform_id=Select+platform&start_date%5Bday%5D=11&start_date%5Bmonth%5D=6&start_date%5Byear%5D=2012)

## Data Driven Organization

**At ContextLogic, we make every product decision based on rigorous data analysis. We deploy a robust A/B testing framework continuously to make informed decisions.** From the color of a "Buy" button to title copy, we track and compare the performance of old and new versions to validate or reject our hypothesis.

Because we firmly believe in data-driven product development, logging is the second highest priority only after serving. Every time our engineers add a new feature to the codebase, I review the code to ensure that the feature comes with thorough logging. When new engineers come on board, I explain to them in detail how critical logging is to us and why.

## How we use Treasure Data

It is one thing to say, "We should log everything" and another to actually do it. In theory, logging is not difficult. **In practice, it is surprisingly costly to log data reliably and efficiently.** In the past, we tried Scribe, the logging software open-sourced by Facebook. Scribe was performant and robust, but it was resource-intensive to configure, build, and maintain on the scale we are at. It also had compatibility issues with our version of Python.

It really comes to the question of "How much time do we want to spend on logging?" and the answer is "As little time as possible while logging everything correctly and keeping data accessible."

Enter [Treasure Data](http://treasure-data.com) [1].

Treasure Data is a cloud storage/computation platform that provides a HiveQL (Apache Hive) interface. As someone who once cut teeth setting up Hadoop clusters and running large-scale MapReduce jobs, I immediately saw its value. We signed up for the service and started logging all of our data. Using their Python driver, it was as easy as adding a few lines to our code.

We have been using Treasure Data for 6 months now, and it's been great so far. The service is reliable. We log millions of events (tens of millions of line items) per day and have had few bad requests so far. They also provide first-class support, boosting my confidence in the service.

## Focus on Product, NOT Managing Infrastructure

**As a lead engineer, I am pleased to see how much time Treasure Data is saving us.** Our engineers no longer worry about maintaining a logging framework or troubleshooting Scribe. Instead, they focus on what to log and how to use the logged data to make our products better. Trust me, when you only have 10 engineers or so, the last thing you want is 5 of them scratching their heads why logging is not working.

## Advice to Startups
As startups, we must wisely allocate our limited resources and focus on making a great product. To improve the product, however, you need to log relevant data. This creates a dilemma: How can we log thoroughly **and** accurately while spending as little time as possible on logging? [Treasure Data](http://treasure-data.com) was our solution, and I strongly recommend it to you as well.

1. The reader may have concerns about uploading access logs to a third-party service like Treasure Data. It's a valid concern, and we have you covered. We worked closely with ContextLogic's data infrastructure team to ensure that any identity-related information is anonymized or filtered out to stay compliant with data privacy guidelines.
