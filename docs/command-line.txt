# Command-line Interface

The Treasure Data CLI allows you to create databases and tables, issue queries and view existing job results, and import/export data.

## Installation

Install the [Treasure Data Toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com/) to set up your local workstation with `td`, the Treasure Data command-line client.

NOTE: If you've followed the [Quickstart Guide](quickstart), you've already installed this.

If you are familiar with Ruby, you can install `td` from the command line using `gem`.

    :::term
    $ gem install td

Alternative installation options, including a Mac OSX installer and a Windows installer, can be found on the [Treasure Data Toolbelt page](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com/).

## Usage

Running `td help:all` shows the commands available in Treasure Data:

    :::term
    $ td help:all
  
      db:list             # Show list of tables in a database
      db:show <db>        # Describe a information of a database
      db:create <db>      # Create a database
      db:delete <db>      # Delete a database
      
      ....
