# Hive (SQL-style) Query Language

This guide covers the basics of SQL-like query language.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including the latest installed version of the toolbelt.

## About Apache Hive

Treasure Data enables the users to use HiveQL, the query language powered by [Apache Hive](http://hive.apache.org/) as the first and primary way to process the dataset.

NOTE: The users can issue only "SELECT" statement. Other statements like Data Definition Statements, Data Manipulation Statements are not allowed.

## Tutorial

## Example Queries

Here you have weblog, which consists of ip, url, and time field.

#### Count # of Records

    :::sql
    SELECT COUNT(1) FROM www_access;

#### Count # of Unique IPs

    :::sql
    SELECT COUNT(distinct v['ip']) FROM www_access;

#### Unique IPs which Accessed Top Page

    :::sql
    SELECT COUNT(distinct v['ip']) FROM www_access \
      WHERE v['url']='/';

#### Group Uniques IPs and Count # of Accesses

    :::sql
    SELECT v['ip'], COUNT(*) FROM www_access \
      GROUP BY v['ip'] LIMIT 30;

#### Sort Unique IPs by # of Accesses

    :::sql
    SELECT v['ip'], COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM www_access \
      GROUP BY v['ip']
      ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 30;

#### Limit logs to process by timestamp

'time' column is a special column that describes UNIX timestamp of the log.

    :::sql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM www_access \
      WHERE time >= unix_timestamp('2011-08-19 00:00:00');

#### Aggregate hourly logs

    :::sql
    SELECT from_unixtime(CAST(time/(60*60*24) AS INT)*60*60*24) AS day, \
      COUNT(*) FROM www_access \
      GROUP BY CAST(time/(60*60*24) AS INT);
