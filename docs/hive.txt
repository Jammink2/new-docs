# Hive (SQL-style) Query Language

[Treasure Data](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is an analytics infrastructure as a service. We provide a SQL-like query language interface called the Hive query language. This article covers the basics of the Hive query language.

## About Apache Hive

The Hive query language (HiveQL) is the primary data processing method for Treasure Data. HiveQL is powered by [Apache Hive](http://hive.apache.org/). [Treasure Data](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is a cloud data platform that allows users to collect, store, and analyze their data on the cloud. Treasure Data manages its own Hadoop cluster, which accepts queries from users and executes them using the Hadoop MapReduce framework. HiveQL is one of the languages it supports.

## SELECT Statement Syntax

Here's the syntax of Hive's SELECT statement.

    :::text
    SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] select_expr, select_expr, ...
    FROM table_reference
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY col_list]
    [HAVING having_condition]
    [CLUSTER BY col_list | [DISTRIBUTE BY col_list] [SORT BY col_list]]
    [LIMIT number]
    ;

SELECT is the projection operator in SQL. The points are:

* `SELECT` scans the table specified by the `FROM` clause
* `WHERE` gives the condition of what to filter
* `GROUP BY` gives a list of columns which specify how to aggregate the records
* `CLUSTER BY`, `DISTRIBUTE BY`, `SORT BY` specify the sort order and algorithm
* `LIMIT` specifies how many # of records to retrieve

### Computing with Columns

When you select the columns, you can manipulate column values using either arithmetic operators or function calls. Math, date, and string functions are popular.

* [List of Arithmetic Operators](hive-operators#arithmetic-operators)
* [List of Functions](hive-functions)

Here's an example query that uses both operators and functions.

    :::sql
    SELECT upper(name), sales_cost FROM products;

### WHERE Clauses

A `WHERE` clause is used to filter the result set by using *predicate operators* and *logical operators*. Functions can also be used to compute the condition.

* [List of Predicate Operators](hive-operators#predicate-operators)
* [List of Logical Operators](hive-operators#logical-operators)
* [List of Functions](hive-functions)

Here's an example query that uses a WHERE clause.

    :::sql
    SELECT name FROM products WHERE name = 'stone of jordan';

### GROUP BY Clauses

A `GROUP BY` clause is frequently used with *aggregate functions*, to group the result set by columns and apply aggregate functions over each group. Functions can also be used to compute the grouping key.

* [List of Aggregate Functions](hive-aggregate-functions)
* [List of Functions](hive-functions)

Here's an example query that groups and counts by category.

    :::sql
    SELECT category, count(1) FROM products GROUP BY category;

### HAVING Clauses

A `HAVING` clause lets you filter the groups produced by `GROUP BY`, by applying *predicate operators* to each groups.

* [List of Predicate Operators](hive-operators#predicate-operators)

Here's an example query that groups and counts by category, and then retrieves only counts > 10;

    :::sql
    SELECT category, count(1) AS cnt FROM products GROUP BY category HAVING cnt > 10;

### Example Queries

Here are some basic examples. The underlying table consists of three fields: `ip`, `url`, and `time`.

    :::sql
    # Number of Records
    SELECT COUNT(1) FROM www_access;

    # Number of Unique IPs
    SELECT COUNT(1) FROM ( \
      SELECT DISTINCT ip FROM www_access \
    ) t;

    # Number of Unique IPs that Accessed the Top Page
    SELECT COUNT(distinct ip) FROM www_access \
      WHERE url='/';

    # Number of Accesses per Unique IP
    SELECT ip, COUNT(1) FROM www_access \
      GROUP BY ip LIMIT 30;

    # Unique IPs Sorted by Number of Accesses
    SELECT ip, COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access \
      GROUP BY ip
      ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 30;

    # Number of Accesses After a Certain Time
    SELECT COUNT(1) FROM www_access \
      WHERE TD_TIME_RANGE(time, "2011-08-19", NULL, "PDT")

    # Number of Accesses Each Day
    SELECT \
      TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd", "PDT") AS day, \
      COUNT(1) AS cnt \
    FROM www_access \
    GROUP BY TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd", "PDT")


[TD_TIME_RANGE UDF](udfs#tdtimerange) is simple and efficient to use. Please refer to the [Performance Tuning](performance-tuning) article for more information.

NOTE: The `time` column is a special column that is always present and stores the UNIX timestamp of the log.

## INSERT Statement Syntax

Here's the syntax of Hive's INSERT statement.

    :::text
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tablename1 select_statement1 FROM from_statement;
    INSERT INTO TABLE tablename1 select_statement1 FROM from_statement;

* INSERT OVERWRITE will overwrite any existing data in the table.
* INSERT INTO will append to the table, keeping the existing data intact.
* If record doesn't include `time` column, `time` column is imported [TD_SCHEDULED_TIME()](<%= @env[:url_doc] %>articles/udfs#tdscheduledtime).
* If record includes `time` column, `time` coulmn should be Unixtime.

NOTE: Query doesn't allow multiple inserts.
NOTE: All INSERT INTO statements require FROM clause.

## Hive Syntax Checker

If you would like to experiment with the Hive SQL syntax, we made our
Hive Syntax linter publicly available [here](https://sql.treasuredata.com).
