## Bug Fixes

These are the most important Bug Fixes made in this release:

### Backend: <tt>TD_TIME_RANGE</tt> and Time-Index Pushdown

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  The <tt>TD_TIME_RANGE</tt> UDF behaved in an inconsistent manner relative to its documentation. When the end time and Timezone were set to null, it read the full time range.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  This was due to the Timezone parameter being set to null when normally it is either not null or omitted.<br/>
  Now the behavior is consistent with the documentation and it uses the default UTC timezone if the timezone is <tt>NULL</tt>.<br/>

### APIs: CPU Cores Utilization Resolution

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Core utilization history cannot display non-integer values, causing hourly utilization that cumulates to less than 1 unit to be rounded down to 0.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  Core utilization is now using floating point numbers.<br/>

### Console: Support Portal

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  The integration between the Support Portal based off Salesforce's Desk.com and the Console does not cover all possible workflows and use cases required.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  Added the <tt>/auth/td</tt> integration endpoint and made it redirect to the signup page if the user is not logged in into the Console.<br/>
  _**[Known Limitation]**_<br/>
  Redirection back to Desk.com upon successful login into the Console is not implemented. The user will need to click on the Support button after logging in to visit the support page and create cases.<br/>
