# Storing Logs Locally and Remotely

You might want to store your logs into your local nodes. td-agent can deal with that case, by using 'copy' function.

## Local Disk and Treasure Data

The configuration below will store your logs into local disk (*/mnt/archive/logs*), and Treasure Data. The files are created in hourly basis.

    :::term
    <match td.*.*>
      type copy
      <store>
        type file
        path /mnt/archive/logs
        time_slice_format %Y%m%d%h
      </store>
      <store>
        type tdlog
        apikey YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        auto_create_table
        buffer_type file
        buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
      </store>
    </match>

Please refer [here](http://fluentd.org/doc/plugin.html#file), for more options for file output.

## Local MongoDB and Treasure Data

The configuration below will store your logs into local MongoDB ReplicaSet, and Treasure Data. The logs are flushed into MongoDB every 60 seconds.

    :::term
    <match td.*.*>
      type copy
      <store>
        type mongo_replset
        database td
        collection logs
        nodes localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019
      </store>
      <store>
        type tdlog
        apikey YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        auto_create_table
        buffer_type file
        buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
      </store>
    </match>

Please refer [here](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-plugin-mongo), for more options for MongoDB output. The plugin has more feature like authentication, capped collection, etc.
