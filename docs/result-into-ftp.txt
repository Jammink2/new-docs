### For On-demand Jobs

For on-demand jobs, just add the `--result` option to the `td query` command. After the job is finished, the results are sent to the specified FTP server.

    :::term
    $ td query \
      --result 'ftp://user:password@domain.com/path.csv' \
      -w -d testdb \
      "SELECT v['code'] AS code, COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access GROUP BY v['code']"

NOTE: If a port number is not specified, the default value is 21.

The request body is in CSV format ([RFC 4180](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt)) where the first line is a header with the column names, new line is CRLF, text encoding is UTF-8, and quotation character is double quotes.

    :::csv
    _c0,_c1
    a,b
    c," d "
    e,f

### For Scheduled Jobs

For scheduled jobs, just add the `--result` option when scheduling a job. After every job run, the results are sent in the same manner as on-demand jobs.

    :::term
    $ td result:create myftp ftp://user:password@domain.com/
    $ td sched:create hourly_count_example "0 * * * *" \
      -d testdb \
      --result myftp:path.csv \
      "SELECT v['code'] AS code, COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access GROUP BY v['code']"
