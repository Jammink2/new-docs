# Monitoring td-agent

This article covers how to monitor `td-agent` daemon.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, at least passed [Getting Started](quickstart) guide.
  * Basic knowledge of [td-agent](td-agent)

## Port Monitoring

By default configuration, td-agent opens these ports. Checking the availability of these port is recommended. If you send no data, the daemon doesn't do anything.

  * TCP 0.0.0.0 8888 (HTTP)
  * TCP 0.0.0.0 24224 (Forward)

Debug port is also opened only to the local communication.

  * TCP 127.0.0.1 24230

## Process Monitoring

Two `ruby` processes (parents and child) are executed. Please make sure these processes are running.

    :::term
    /usr/lib/fluent/ruby/bin/ruby /usr/sbin/td-agent
      --daemon /var/run/td-agent/td-agent.pid
      --log /var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
