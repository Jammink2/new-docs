# Streaming Import from Python Apps

'[fluent-logger-python](http://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-python)' is used to import data from Python applications to Treasure Data. 

This article explains how to use the fluent-logger-python library.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Python.
  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including the [toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com).
  * Python 2.6 or higher (for local testing).

## What is Treasure Agent?

First of all, Treasure Agent (`td-agent`) needs to be installed on your application servers. Treasure Agent is an agent program sits within your application servers, focusing on uploading application logs to the cloud.

The [fluent-logger-python](http://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-python) library enables Python applications to post records to their local td-agent. td-agent in turn uploads the data to the cloud every 5 minutes. Because the daemon runs on a local node, the logging latency is negligible.

## How to install Treasure Agent?

This video demonstrates how to install Treasure Agent in 3 minutes.

### Step 1: Installing Treasure Agent

To install Treasure Agent (`td-agent`), please execute one of the command below based on your environment. The agent program will be installed automatically by using the package management software for each platform like rpm/deb/dmg.

#### MacOS X 10.9+

    :::term
    $ open 'http://packages.treasuredata.com/2/macosx/td-agent-2.1.4-0.dmg'

#### RHEL/CentOS 5,6,7

    :::term
    $ curl -L http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent2.sh | sh

#### Ubuntu & Debian

    :::term
    # 14.04 Trusty (64bit only)
    $ curl -L http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-trusty-td-agent2.sh | sh
    # 12.04 Precise
    $ curl -L http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-precise-td-agent2.sh | sh
    # 10.04 Lucid
    $ curl -L http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-lucid-td-agent2.sh | sh
    
    # Debian Squeeze (64bit only)
    $ curl -L http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-debian-squeeze-td-agent2.sh | sh
    # Debian Wheezy (64bit only)
    $ curl -L http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-debian-wheezy-td-agent2.sh | sh

#### Amazon Linux

    :::term
    $ curl -L http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-td-agent2.sh | sh

#### Opscode Chef (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/treasure-data/chef-td-agent">repository</a>)

    :::term
    $ echo 'cookbook "td-agent"' >> Berksfile
    $ berks install

[Joyent SmartOS](http://help.treasuredata.com/customer/portal/articles/1246933-installing-td-agent-on-joyent-smartos) and <a href="https://github.com/treasure-data/elastic-beanstalk-td-agent">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a> are also supported. Amazon Linux & Windows are currently NOT supported.

### Step 2: Modifying /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf

Next, please specify your API key by setting the `apikey` option. You can view your api key from the [console](<%= @env[:url_profile] %>). Note: *YOUR_API_KEY* should be your actual apikey string.

    :::text
    # Treasure Data Input and Output
    <source>
      type forward
      port 24224
    </source>
    
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      apikey YOUR_API_KEY
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
    </match>

NOTE: <i>YOUR_API_KEY</i> should be your actual apikey string. You can retrieve your api key from <a href="<%= @env[:url_profile] %>" target="_blank">HERE</a>. Using the write-only key is recommended.

Please restart your agent once these lines are in place.

    :::term
    # Linux
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    
    # MacOS X
    $ sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/td-agent.plist
    $ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/td-agent.plist

td-agent will now accept data via port 24224, buffer it (*var/log/td-agent/buffer/td*), and automatically upload it into the cloud.

### Step 3: Using fluent-logger-python

First, install the fluent-logger library via pip.

    :::term
    $ pip install fluent-logger

Next, initialize and post the records as follows.

    :::python
    # Initialize
    from fluent import sender
    from fluent import event
    sender.setup('td.test_db', host='localhost', port=24224)
    event.Event('follow', {
      'from': 'userA',
      'to':   'userB'
    })

### Step 4: Confirm the Import

First, please execute the program above.

    :::term
    $ python test.py

Sending a SIGUSR1 signal will flush td-agent's buffer; upload will start immediately.

    :::term
    # Linux
    $ kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/td-agent/td-agent.pid`
    
    # MacOS X
    $ sudo kill -USR1 `sudo launchctl list | grep td-agent | cut -f 1`

To confirm that your data has been uploaded successfully, issue the *td tables* command as shown below.

    :::term
    $ td tables
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | Database   | Table      | Type | Count     |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | test_db    | follow     | log  | 1         |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+

## Production Deployments

### Use gunicorn, tornado or modwsgi

We recommend that you use [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/), [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) or [modwsgi](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/). Other setups have not been fully validated.

### High-Availablability Configurations of td-agent

For high-traffic websites (more than 5 application nodes), we recommend using a high availability configuration of td-agent. This will improve data transfer reliability and query performance.

* [High-Availability Configurations of td-agent](td-agent-high-availability)

### Monitoring td-agent

Monitoring td-agent itself is also important. Please refer to this document for general monitoring methods for td-agent.

* [Monitoring td-agent](td-agent-monitoring)

NOTE: td-agent is fully open-sourced under the <a href="http://fluentd.org/">fluentd project</a>.

## Next Steps

We offer a schema mechanism that is more flexible than that of traditional RDBMSs. For queries, we leverage the Hive Query Language.
