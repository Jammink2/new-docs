# Using the Web Console

The Treasure Data [Web Console](http://console.treasuredata.com/) gives an overview of your account, including information about databases, tables, and jobs you've created. The console also shows the total storage size of your data (in bytes) and the total number of records you've accumulated.

## Databases

The Databases page gives a list of all the databases you've created, the number of records they contain, the creation times, etc. Selecting an individual database shows all the tables that it contains. You can also create a new database by clicking on the "+" icon in the top righthand corner

## Job Results
Clicking on the "Jobs" link on the navigation panel gives a list of all your recent jobs (and their status). For all jobs that ran successfully, the result is available in TXT, CSV, and TSV format. For jobs that are currently still running, you have the option of killing it.

Click on a job ID to go to the job details page, which shows basic information about the job, as well as the original query and the stderr and cmdout. This shows you exactly how the job performed and lets you debug any errors that may have occured.

## Issue New Queries
On the "Query" page, you can select a database and issue a new query. After clicking "Submit", you will be taken to the job details page for the new query.
