# Using the Web Console

The Treasure Data [Web Console](<%= @env[:url_console] %>) gives an overview of your account, including information about databases & tables, jobs, scheduled queries, users, resource utilization, managing users, as well as creating new queries. The Web Console implements exactly the same functionalities provided by td CLI and some more.

## Databases & Tables

Please visit the Console's [databases page](<%= @env[:url_databases] %>).

Each database show in the list above can own 0 to any number of tables. For example, click on the default 'sample_db' database to see the list of tables.
Click on the table name to see a preview of the table content in the Table detailed view.

## Jobs

Please visit this page to get to [list of jobs](<%= @env[:url_job] %>). Jobs can be filtered by 'Running', 'Finished', 'Failed', and 'Slow'.

Click on any of the job numbers to view the job details page. Click on any of the databases each job refers to, to visit the corresponding database.

Click on a job ID to go to the job details page, which shows basic information about the job, as well as the original query, as well as the job's output and details information. This shows you exactly how the job performed and gives you an high level overview of any error that may have occurred.

## New Queries and Schedules

Please visit the [new query page](<%= @env[:url_console] %>/query_forms/new) to create a new query or define a new schedules query. This page also allow specifying a target to write the query output result onto.

## Schedules

The [schedules list](<%= @env[:url_console] %>/schedules) shows the list of the schedules for the account.
Clicking on any of the schedules will open the schedule details page with information about it, the query associated to it, as well as a list of all the jobs that originated from the query itself.

## Utilization

The [utilization page](<%= @env[:url_console] %>/utilization) summarizes the utilization of the allocated computation cores as well as the total number of records, the total compressed size,  and number of queries issues.

## Users and Access Control

The [users page](<%= @env[:url_users] %>) displays the users associated with an account. The [users page](<%= @env[:url_users] %>) is visible only to acount owners and administrators: there can only be one account user owner per account, whereas any of the users can be granted administrator access.

Various other roles are designed below administrator. See the table at [Access Control](access-control) for a summary of the permissions associated with each role.
