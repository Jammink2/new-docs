# Sending Query Results to Web Server

This article explains how to send job results directly to your web server.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including [the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com).
  * A web server configured to accept the results in the form of PUT requests

## Basic Usage

### For On-demand Jobs

For on-demand jobs, just add the `-r` option to the `td query` command. After the job is finished, the results are sent via a PUT request to the domain, port, and path specified.  The request body is a JSON with the following fields: column_names, column_types, and data (the result of the query).

    :::term
    $ td query
      -r 'web://domain.com:80/path' \
      -w -d testdb \
      "SELECT v['code'] AS code, COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access GROUP BY v['code']"

### For Scheduled Jobs

For scheduled jobs, just add the `-r` option when scheduling a job. After every job run, the results are sent via PUT requests in the same fashion as described previously.

    :::term
    $ td result:create myweb web://domain.com:80/
    $ td sched:create hourly_count_example "0 * * * *" \
      -d testdb \
      -r myweb:path \
      "SELECT v['code'] AS code, COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access GROUP BY v['code']"
