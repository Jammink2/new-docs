# Sending Query Results to a Web Server

This article explains how to send job results directly to your web server.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including [the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com).
  * A web server configured to accept query results as PUT requests.

## Basic Usage

### For On-demand Jobs

For on-demand jobs, just add the `--result` option to the `td query` command. After the job is finished, the results are sent to the specified URL via a PUT request.

    :::term
    $ td query \
      --result 'web://domain.com/path' \
      -w -d testdb \
      "SELECT v['code'] AS code, COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access GROUP BY v['code']"

Here is another example URL. [Basic HTTP authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) and port specification are supported.

    :::text
    web://user:pass@domain.com:8080/path1/path2

We also support transfer via HTTPS if you use `webs` as the protocol header instead of `web`. For example:

    :::text
    webs://securedomain.com/path1/path2

NOTE: If a port number is not specified, the default value is 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. If username and password are not given, then authentication is not used.

The request body is a JSON with the following fields: column_names, column_types, and data (the result of the query).  An example of what the query above may output is shown below.

    :::json
    { column_names: [ 'code', 'cnt' ],
      column_types: [ 'string', 'long' ],
      data: [ [ '200', 4981 ], [ '500', 2 ], [ '404', 17 ] ] }

NOTE: The maximum number of rows is 100,000. If the result exceeds 100,000 rows, the remaining rows are thrown away.

### For Scheduled Jobs

For scheduled jobs, just add the `--result` option when scheduling a job. After every job run, the results are sent via PUT requests in the same manner as on-demand jobs.

    :::term
    $ td result:create myweb web://domain.com/
    $ td sched:create hourly_count_example "0 * * * *" \
      -d testdb \
      --result myweb:path \
      "SELECT v['code'] AS code, COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access GROUP BY v['code']"
