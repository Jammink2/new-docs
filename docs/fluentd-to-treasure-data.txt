# Continuous Data Import from Fluentd

This article covers how to continuously import the data with `fluentd`.

## About Fluentd

[Fluentd](http://fluentd.org/) is a log collector daemon written in Ruby. Fluentd receives logs as JSON streams, buffers them, and sends them to other systems like MySQL, MongoDB, or even other instances of Fluentd.

We're providing `td-agent` as rpm/deb package which contains Fluentd, howevery, there're many Fluentd users which installs fluentd by Ruby gems. This article is for them.

**Not for td-agent users, but for Fluentd gem users**. The instruction with `td-agent` is <a href="/td-agent">described separately</a>.

## Use fluent-plugin-td

At first, please install `fluentd` and `fluent-plugin-td` gem by this command.

    :::term
    $ gem install fluentd
    $ gem install fluent-plugin-td

Then, please put those lines to your configuration file. `fluent-plugin-td` contains `tdlog` output, which uploads the data into Treasure Data.

    :::text
    # HTTP input
    <source>
      type http
      port 8888
    </source>
    
    # Treasure Data output
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      apikey ...
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /path/to/buffer/td
      use_ssl true
    </match>

## Confirm Data Upload

At first, please start fluentd server.

    :::term
    $ ./bin/fluentd --config fluentd.conf

Second, You can add logs in JSON using HTTP.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"action":"login","user":2}' \
      http://localhost:8888/td.testdb.www_access

`fluentd` continuously uploads logs every minute. By sending SIGUSR1 signal, you can force `fluentd` to flush the buffered logs into the cloud.

    :::term
    $ kill -USR1 <pid_of_fluentd>

You can confirm that your data was imported successfully by running `td tables`:

    :::term
    $ td tables
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | Database   | Table      | Type | Count     |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | testdb     | www_access | log  | 1         |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+

If you run into an issue, fluentd's log is a good place to start your investigation.
