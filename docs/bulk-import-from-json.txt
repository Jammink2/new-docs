# Bulk Import from JSON file

This article explains how to import data from JSON files to Treasure Data.

## Install Bulk Loader

First, install the [toolbelt](command-line), which includes bulk loader program, on your computer.

#### Downloads
- [Toolbelt Installer for Windows](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/win)
- [Toolbelt Installer for Mac OS X](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/mac)
- [Toolbelt Installer for Linux](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/linux)

After the installation, the `td` command will be installed on your computer. Open up the terminal, and type `td` to execute the command. Also, please make sure you have `java` as well. Execute `td import:jar_update` to download the up-to-date version of our bulk loader:

    :::term
    $ td
    usage: td [options] COMMAND [args]
    $ java
    Usage: java [-options] class [args...]
    $ td import:jar_update
    Installed td-import.jar 0.x.xx into /path/to/.td/java

## Importing data from a JSON

Suppose you have a file called <tt>data.json</tt> and its content looks like this:

    :::term
    $ head -n 1 data.json
    {"host":"224.225.147.72","user":"-","method":"GET","path":"/category/electronics","code":200,"referer":"-","size":43,"agent":"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)","date_time":"2004-03-07 16:05:49"}

Execute the following command to upload the JSON file:

    $ td db:create my_db
    $ td table:create my_db my_tbl
    $ td import:auto \
      --format json \
      --time-column date_time \
      --time-format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" \
      --auto-create my_db.my_tbl \
      ./data.json

NOTE: Because `td import:auto` executes MapReduce jobs to check the invalid rows, it'll take at least <b>1-2 minutes</b>.

In the above command, we assumed that:

* The data file is called `data.json` and is located in the current directory (hence <tt>./data.json</tt>)
* The JSON format typically specifies the column names. If it does not, you will have to specify the column names with the
  <tt>\-\-columns</tt> options (and optionally the column types with <tt>\-\-column-types</tt> option), or use the <tt>\-\-column-types</tt> for each column
  in the file.
* The time field is called "date_time" and it's specified with the <tt>\-\-time-column</tt> option
* The time format is <tt>%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S</tt> and it's specified with the <tt>\-\-time-format</tt> option
