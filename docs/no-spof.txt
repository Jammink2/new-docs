# No Single-Point-Of-Failure (SPOF)

Hadoop has [a famous single-point-of-failure problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4502275/hadoop-namenode-single-point-of-failure) that is being addressed by the community. We're taking a different approach: prepare multiple Hadoop clusters across multiple data centers.

If a Hadoop cluster dies, your job will be automatically reassigned to another live cluster. Our computing resources are always shared across our users.
