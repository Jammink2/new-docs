# Analyzing Apache Logs

This guide explains how to import Apache logs with ‘td-agent’. The basic idea is that td-agent (1) continuously accepts new Apache logs, (2) parses the logs, and (3) periodically batch uploads the logs into the cloud. td-agent’s ‘tail’ source type is used.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including the latest installed version of the toolbelt.
  * Basic knowledge of td-agent.
  * An installed version of Ruby 1.8 or higher (for local testing).

## Architecture

<center><img src="/images/apache_log_with_td-agent.png" width="90%" /></center>

‘td-agent’ is a daemon program dedicated to the continuous upload of any kind of streaming log data. td-agent is developed and maintained by Treasure Data, Inc.

When a user accesses Apache, Apache appends a corresponding log entry to the log file (typically located at */var/log/apache2/access_log*). td-agent continuously ‘tails’ the access log, identifying the newly created log entries.

td-agent automatically parses the new logs to create meaningful data fields (ex: ip, path, etc). The resulting data is buffered, periodically compressed, then uploaded to the cloud.

## Installing td-agent

You must first set up `td-agent` on your application servers. Please refer to the following articles; we provide deb/rpm packages for Linux systems.

  <tr>
    <th>If you have...</th>
    <th>Please look at...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Debian / Ubuntu Systems</td>
    <td><a href="http://treasure-data.tenderapp.com/kb/installing-td-agent-daemon/installing-td-agent-for-debian-and-ubuntu">Installing td-agent for Debian and Ubuntu</a></td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
</table>

NOTE: td-agent is fully open-sourced under the <a href="http://github.com/fluent/">fluentd project</a>. td-agent extends fluentd with custom plugins for Treasure Data.

## Modifying /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf

In order to import Apache logs with td-agent, you'll need to add the following lines to your td-agent.conf file. Please specify the database name and table name using the ‘tag’ parameter, as shown below.

    :::term
    # tail apache access_log
    <source>
      type tail
      path /var/log/apache2/access_log
      format apache
      tag td.YOUR_DATABASE_NAME.YOUR_TABLE_NAME
    </source>

For example, if you set ‘td.testdb.apache_logs’ as the tag, the logs are sent to the `apache_logs` table within the `testdb` database.
    
Next, please specify your authentication key by setting the `apikey` option. You can view your api key with the `td apikey:show` command.

NOTE: You must first authenticate your account using the `td account` command.

    :::term
    $ td apikey:show
    3b7118fd3ad7e35bbd3c0e4f607ec7263aa93c30

Next, please set the `apikey` option in your td-agent.conf file. 

Note: *YOUR_API_KEY* should be your actual apikey string.

    :::term
    # Treasure Data Input and Output
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      apikey YOUR_API_KEY
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
    </match>

Please restart your agent once these lines are in place.

    :::term
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

In this configuration, td-agent tails the Apache logs, parses the new log records, and uploads the data into the cloud every 5 minutes.

## Confirming Import

You often don't want to wait for these 5 minute cycles. Sending a SIGUSR1 signal will flush td-agent's buffer; upload will start immediately.

    :::term
    $ kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/td-agent/td-agent.pid`

To confirm that your data has been uploaded successfully, issue the `td tables` command as shown below.

    :::term
    $ td tables
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | Database   | Table      | Type | Count     |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | test_db    | test_table | log  | 21321     |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
