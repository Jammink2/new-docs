## Bug Fixes

This the only important Bug Fix made in this release:

### Backend: Single Line Comments in Pig

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  [Single line comments](http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/piglatin_ref1.html#Using+Comments+in+Scripts) cause the Pig script to return all records from the wrong table.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  Pig queries are preprocessed before execution and transformed into a sequence of commands in a single line. These commands are automatically prepended by as many LOAD statements as the number of tables in the database and appended with a STORE statement to store the result contained in the last referenced variable. Single line comments (those starting with --) caused the whole user inputted portion of the Pig script following the comment to be ignored: the result of the query appeared as to contain records from a table different from the one expected. Particularly if the single line comment was in the first line of the script, the whole script was ignored and the result corresponded to the content of the last table in the databases, according to the last LOAD executed in the preamble of the script.<br/>
  Comments are now preprocessed and stripped from the query before execution to avoid this problem.<br/>

### Bulk Import: Empty or Nil Time Column in CSV / TSV

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  A Null Pointer Exception (NPE) occurs while parsing a CSV / TSV file when the time column contains nil or empty values and the --time-format options is used.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  The exception is caused by the improper handling of empty and nil strings, which can sometime appear in the time column.<br/>
  Improved the parsing to avoid this pitfall and report a symbolic time=0 when either nil value or an empty string is encountered.<br/>

### Bulk Import: Import-Only Permissions

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Users with import only access to a database or using import-only API keys cannot import using Bulk Import.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  This was due to the attempt to list the tables in the database when creating a session to verify the destination table actually existed. The table list operation is forbidden when the user has import only permissions to a database.<br/>
  Client side validation is removed since the check is performed by the APIs.<br/>
