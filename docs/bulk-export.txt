# Bulk Export

This article explains Treasure Data's bulk-export feature, which lets you dump data into your Amazon S3 bucket.

At Treasure Data, we believe that your data belongs to you, even after importing it to our platform. We believe that vendor-lockin MUST be stopped.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including the [Treasure Data Toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com).
  * Amazon AWS account and Amazon S3 bucket.

## Table Dump

The `td table:export` command will dump all the data uploaded to TD into your Amazon S3 bucket. Please specify the database and table from which to dump your data.

The dump is performed via MapReduce jobs.
