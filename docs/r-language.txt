# R Language with JDBC Driver

This article shows how to use Treasure Data with the [R language](http://www.r-project.org/) by using the [RJDBC](http://www.rforge.net/RJDBC/) package.

## Download

You can download the Treasure Data RJDB driver from the link below. The driver is still in beta, so any feedback is appreciated.

* [JDBC Driver Download](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com/jdbc)

NOTE: This driver only works with Treasure Data. It does not work in other environments such as your local Hadoop/Hive cluster.

## Installing the RJDBC Package

First, please install the [RJDBC Package](http://www.rforge.net/RJDBC/) as shown below:

    :::term
    $ R
    > install.packages("RJDBC",dep=TRUE)

## Issuing Queries

To issue queries, please use the RJDBC package together with the Treasure Data JDBC driver.

    :::r
    library(RJDBC)
    drv <- JDBC("com.treasure_data.jdbc.TreasureDataDriver",
                "/path/to/td-jdbc-<td-jdbc.version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar",
                identifier.quote="`")
    conn <- dbConnect(drv,
                      "jdbc:td://api.treasure-data.com/testdb",
                      "YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE",
                      "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE")
    dbListTables(conn)
    dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access")
