# R Language with Treasure Data JDBC Driver

This guide covers how to use Treasure Data with [R language](http://www.r-project.org/), through [RJDBC](http://www.rforge.net/RJDBC/) package.

## Download

You can download the driver itself from here. The driver is still in beta quality, so please report to us if you have any problems.

NOTE: This driver works only with Treasure Data, doesn't work with other environments like your local Hadoop/Hive cluster.

## Install RJDBC Package

                "/path/to/td-jdbc-0.1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar",
                identifier.quote="`")
    conn <- dbConnect(drv,
                      "jdbc:td://api.treasure-data.com/testdb",
                      "YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE",
                      "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE")
    dbListTables(conn)
    dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM www_access")
