# Treasure Data iOS SDK

This article will help you start sending the data from your iOS app to Treasure Data, using our iOS SDK library.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of iOS Development (Xcode, [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/))
  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data.

NOTE: iOS SDK is now under the <b>Beta</b> phase. Any feedbacks or bug reports are welcomed.

## Step 1: Install the Library

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a recommended way to install Treasure Data iOS SDK. First, please install CocoaPods to your PC.

    :::term
    $ gem install cocoapods

Add the following line to your Podfile:

    :::ruby
    pod 'TreasureData-iOS-SDK'

Finally, please run `pod install`.

    :::term
    $ pod install

## Step 2: Initialize the Library

Once you’ve installed the framework, just import the header file like following:

    :::c
    #import "TreasureData-iOS-SDK/TreasureData.h"

Next, please initialize the library in your app delegate’s `application:applicationDidBecomeActive:` method:

    :::c
    - (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application {
      [TreasureData initializeWithApiKey:@"your_api_key"];
    }

## Step 3: Send Events to the Cloud

Next, please call addEvent() function at the appropriate timing within your applications. This example sends the event to table `table_b` within database `database_a`, when the button was clicked.

    :::c
    - (IBAction)clickButton:(id)sender {
      [[TreasureData sharedInstance] addEvent:@{
        @"name": @"foo bar",
        @"age": @42,
        @"comment": @"hello world"
      }
      database:@"database_a"
      table:@"table_b"];
    }

By default, all events will be bufferred to the file. You **need to explicitly flush** the bufferred data to the cloud. It won't be uploaded automatically.

The folowing code uploads the event when the application goes to the background, which is a fairly common pattern across our customers.

    :::c
    - (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application {
      [[TreasureData sharedInstance] uploadEventsWithBlock:^(void) {
        NSLog(@"Uploaded.");
      }];
    }

## Next Steps

For the transparency, we're open sourcing our iOS SDK on Github. Please check the repository if necessary.
