# Access Control

Treasure Data offers ways to control access to resources and capabilities. Permission and access control settings are
managed within the Console.

## Permissions Overview

The [Team page](<%= @env[:url_users] %>) displays the users associated with an account and visible to **all** users.
The Treasure Data permission system has 3 levels built in:

* **Owner**<br/>
  There can only be one 'Owner' user for each account - it's the user that originally created the account.
  This user has permission to perform **any** permission on the account, including closing it.
* **Administrator(s)**<br/>
  All users in the account are initially added as 'Restricted' (see below for definition).
  Any of these users can be promoted as account 'Administrator'. An account administrator can perform practically any
  operation on an account.  This includes managing other Restricted users' settings but excludes managing other Administrator
  and Owner users' settings.
* **Restricted**<br/>
  'Restricted' is the permission level associated with any new user by default. As the permission system is designed around
  granting permission to databases (read and/or write), restricted users need to be explicitly granted access to a
  database in order to be able to perform any operation.<br/>
  Restricted users can be granted either **Full Access**, **'Query-only'**, or **'Import-only'** access level to any of the
  databases in the account independently. (Please see the table below for details). We modeled these three access levels
  to mimic 'read & write', 'read', and 'write' permissions (with exceptions depicted in the tables below.)
  Restricted users cannot change their whitelist settings.

## REST APIs Access

REST API access is controlled through API keys. Almost every REST API call needs to be issued with a valid API key for
authentication and resource authorization purposes.

There are two types of API keys: **Master** and **Write-only**.<br/>
By default, every new user is created with one Master and one Write-only API key; however, any user can generate any number of the two types of API keys.
Any of the API Keys can be revoked at any time by the user themselves or any user having 'Manage User'
permissions - see table above.

* **Master**<br/>
  This is the traditional type of API key and it can be used to perform all permitted operations
  listed in the table above based on the user's permission level and access, no exception.
* **Write-only**<br/>
  This API key type provides an additional layer of security in controlling access to a Treasure Data account through
  the REST APIs, especially when access has to be provided to 3rd parties or API keys need to be embedded in ingestion
  libraries (see the [Overview of Data Import](import-overview) page).
  Based on the permissions and access levels associated to a user, the user's Write-only API key will only allow
  importing data into Treasure Data to those databases it has *write access* to.

## Access levels

### Console or Master API key

This is a superset of the actions that can be performed through either the Console or the REST APIs - some actions may
not be available at the REST API level and some others (e.g. Data Import) are not available with the Console.

Notes:

1. 'Administrator' users can only 'Manage User' and 'Delete User' for 'Restricted' users but are not allowed to
   manage and delete other Administrators user or the account 'Owner'.<br/>
   The 'Manage User' permission includes granting or
   revoking the 'Administrator' role - therefore an 'Administrator' user can promote a user to 'Administrator' but cannot
   demote an user from 'Administrator' to 'Restricted' user.
2. 'Restricted' users can only see databases they have 'Full Access' or 'Query-only' permissions for. The databases they have
   'Import-only' permissions for won't appear in the list of databases.
3. Any user (including Restricted ones) can create a new database and they will 'own' and have all permissions for it. 'Full Access',
   'Query-only', and 'Import-only' permissions for 'Create Database' don't apply in that case.
   'Restricted' users can only 'Delete' and 'Manage' databases they created (and therefore own). 'Administrators' and
   'Owner' can always manage databases.
4. While the end-goal of INSERT INTO is to write the result back into a table, it requires special permissions. The
   executing user must possess read ('Query-only', 'Full Access', 'Admin', or 'Owner') permissions for all the databases accessed
   by the query as well as read & write permission ('Full Access', 'Admin', or 'Owner') to the database the result is inserted
   into the query will fail otherwise.
5. Restricted users with 'Query-only permission can see all the jobs running on the database they have 'Query-only'
   permissions for but will not be able to kill a job unless it's their own.

Notes:

1. Any user (including Restricted ones) can create a new database and they will 'own' and have all permissions for it. 'Full Access',
   'Query-only', and 'Import-only' permissions for 'Create Database' don't apply in that case.
   'Restricted' users can only 'Delete' and 'Manage' databases they created (and therefore own). 'Administrators' and
   'Owner' can always manage databases.
2. Bulk Import and Result Output to TD (based on Bulk Import) require the ability to check the status of a job, and this
   is not possible using a write-only API key.
3. INSERT INTO requires the ability to execute a query, which is not allowed using a Write-only API key.
