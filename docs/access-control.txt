# Access Control

The [Team page](<%= @env[:url_users] %>) displays the users associated with an account. The [Team page](<%= @env[:url_users] %>) is **visible only the Account Owners** and any of the Administrators**. Three other roles are designed below administrator. See the table below for a summary of the permissions associated with each role:

Provided the user has adequate permission to access the [Team page](https://console.treasuredata.com/users), clicking on any of the users will allow doing one of the following:

* Grant / Deny Administrator permissions;
* Grant / Deny full-access / query-only / import-only access to any of the databases.
* Delete an user

The logged in user's [profile page](<%= @env[:url_profile] %>) is accessible and provides information about the user as well as allowing to change the password and other basic information.

#### Notes

1. Users with 'Query only' permission to a database can see all the jobs running
   on that database but will not be able to kill those jobs unless they are
   their own.
