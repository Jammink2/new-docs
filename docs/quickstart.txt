# Quickstart Guide

Let's get started with Treasure Data! Treasure Data is the first cloud service for the entire data pipeline, including acquisition, storage, and analysis. We manage and support the entire infrastructure so you can focus on analyzing data, rather than managing it.

## Overview & Concepts

If you want to get a short technical introduction to the Treasure Data Service, please take a look at our 8 minute introduction

## Step 1: Sign Up

[Sign up](<%= @env[:url_signup] %>) for Treasure Data if you haven't yet.

## Step 2: Query the Sample Table

Let's query the sample table!

1. Click on the "New Query" tab on the left vertical tab inside the Management Console.
2. Select "sample_db" from the "Database" dropdown menu.
3. Write a query of your choice against the table named "www_access". Here is one example query that counts and sorts HTTP requests by their status codes.

        SELECT
          code AS http_status_code,
          COUNT(1) AS num_requests
        FROM
          www_access
        GROUP BY
          code
        ORDER BY
          num_requests

4. Hit the blue Submit button. You will be sent to the job page where you can track your job's progress.

5. Once the job is done, the "running" sign (in blue) turns into "success" (in green). You can view the results within the Management Console as well as download it as CSV/TSV/JSON (see the red circle below).
