# Known Limitations

The Presto query engine has some limitations compared to Hive at this stage. We welcome your feedback and will make improvements based on these.

## Column Name Escaping

When a column name matches the name of a reserved keyword, the name of the columns needs to be
quoted. While in Hive, as most the SQL-based query languages, the quotation character is the back tick character <tt>`</tt>, in Presto quoting of a column name is accomplished with the double quote character instead <tt>"</tt>. See the comparison below:

    :::sql
    SELECT `join` FROM mytbl      # Hive
    SELECT "join" FROM mytbl      # Presto

Please be aware that quoting a column name in single quotes <tt>'</tt> will make the query parser
interpret the content as a simple string producing a perhaps unexpected result:

    :::sql
    SELECT "join" FROM mytbl LIMIT 10

    result:
    value1
    value2
    value3
    value4
    ...
    value10

    SELECT 'join' FROM mytbl

    result:
    join
    join
    join
    join
    ...
    join

## Table Schemas are Required

When querying via Presto, you must set a [Schema](schema) for the table(s); the `v` syntax doesn't work.

## JOIN Order

Presto does not currently support cost-based JOIN optimizations, meaning JOINs are not automatically reordered based on table size. Please make sure that smaller tables are on the right hand size of JOIN, and they must fit in memory. Otherwise out of memory exceptions will cause the query to fail.

    :::sql
    SELECT
      ...
    FROM
      large_table
    JOIN
      small_table

## INSERT Statements are NOT Supported

Presto does not currently support INSERT Statements, meaning INSERTs are still in development. Please use Result Output feature on Presto or INSERTs on Hive.
