# Data Import from Node.js Applications

'[fluent-logger-node](https://github.com/yssk22/fluent-logger-node)', a 3rd party library, is used to import data from Node.js applications to Treasure Data. 

This article explains how to use the fluent-logger-node library.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Node.js and NPM.
  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including [the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com).
  * Node.js 0.6 or higher (for local testing).

NOTE: The fluent-logger-node library does not work in Heroku (<a href="/articles/heroku-notes">here's why</a>) and EngineYard.

## Installing td-agent

fluent-logger-node requires `td-agent` to be installed on your application servers. td-agent is a daemon program dedicated to the continuous upload of any kind of streaming log data. td-agent is developed and maintained by Treasure Data, Inc.

The [fluent-logger-node](https://github.com/yssk22/fluent-logger-perl) library enables Node.js applications to post records to their local td-agent. td-agent in turn uploads the data to the cloud every 5 minutes. Because the daemon runs on a local node, the logging latency is negligible.

To set up td-agent, please refer to the following articles; we provide deb/rpm packages for Linux systems.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>If you have...</th>
    <th>Please look at...</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Debian / Ubuntu System</td>
    <td><a href="http://treasure-data.tenderapp.com/kb/installing-td-agent-daemon/installing-td-agent-for-debian-and-ubuntu">Installing td-agent for Debian and Ubuntu</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Redhat / CentOS System</td>
    <td><a href="http://treasure-data.tenderapp.com/kb/installing-td-agent-daemon/installing-td-agent-for-redhat-and-centos">Installing td-agent for Redhat and CentOS</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

NOTE: td-agent is fully open-sourced under the <a href="http://fluentd.org/">fluentd project</a>. td-agent extends fluentd with custom plugins for Treasure Data.

## Modifying /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf

Next, please specify your authentication key by setting the `apikey` option. You can view your api key with the *td apikey:show* command.

Note: You must first authenticate your account using the ‘td account’ command.

    :::term
    $ td apikey:show
    3b7118fd3ad7e35bbd3c0e4f607ec7263aa93c30

Next, please set the `apikey` option in your td-agent.conf file. 

Note: *YOUR_API_KEY* should be your actual apikey string.

    :::text
    # Treasure Data Input and Output
    <source>
      type forward
      port 24224
    </source>
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      apikey YOUR_API_KEY
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
      use_ssl true
    </match>

Please restart your agent once these lines are in place.

    :::term
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

td-agent will now accept data via port 24224, buffer it (*var/log/td-agent/buffer/td*), and automatically upload it into the cloud.

## Using fluent-logger-node

### Obtaining the Most Recent Version

The most recent version of fluent-logger-node can be found from [here](http://search.npmjs.org/#/fluent-logger).

### A Sample Application

A sample [Express](http://expressjs.com/) app using fluent-logger-node is shown below.

#### package.json

    :::js
    {
      "name": "node-example",
      "version": "0.0.1",
      "dependencies": {
        "express": "2.5.9",
        "fluent-logger": "0.1.0"
      }
    }

Now use *npm* to install your dependencies locally:

    :::term
    $ npm install
    fluent-logger@0.1.0 ./node_modules/fluent-logger
    express@2.5.9 ./node_modules/express
    |-- qs@0.4.2
    |-- mime@1.2.4
    |-- mkdirp@0.3.0
    |-- connect@1.8.6 (formidable@1.0.9)

#### web.js

This is the simplest web app.

    :::js
    var express = require('express');
    var app = express.createServer(express.logger());

    var logger = require('fluent-logger');
    logger.configure('td.test_db', {host: 'localhost', port: 24224});

    app.get('/', function(request, response) {
      logger.emit('follow', {from: 'userA', to: 'userB'});
      response.send('Hello World!');
    });
    var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(port, function() {
      console.log("Listening on " + port);
    });

Execute the app and go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

    :::term
    $ node web.js

## Confirming Data Import

Sending a SIGUSR1 signal will flush td-agent's buffer; upload will start immediately.

    :::term
    $ kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/td-agent/td-agent.pid`

To confirm that your data has been uploaded successfully, issue the *td tables* command as shown below.

    :::term
    $ td tables
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | Database   | Table      | Type | Count     |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | test_db    | follow     | log  | 1         |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+

NOTE: The first argument of post() determines the database name and table name. If you specify `td.test_db.test_table`, the data will be imported into the table *test_table* within the database *test_db*. They are automatically created at upload time.

## Production Deployments

### High-Availablability Configurations of td-agent

For high-traffic websites (more than 5 application nodes), we recommend using a high availability configuration of td-agent. This will improve data transfer reliability and query performance.

* [High-Availability Configurations of td-agent](td-agent-high-availability)

## Next Steps

We offer a schema mechanism that is more flexible than that of traditional RDBMSs. For queries, we leverage the Hive Query Language.
