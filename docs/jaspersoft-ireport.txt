# JasperSoft iReport with JDBC Driver

This article explains how to use Treasure Data with [JasperSoft iReport](http://jasperforge.org/projects/ireport), by leveraging [our JDBC driver](jdbc-driver). By combining Treasure Data with JasperSoft, you can process huge volumes of data on the cloud, while continuing to use your existing JasperSoft instances.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, at least passed [Getting Started](quickstart) guide.

## Download JasperSoft iReport

You can download JasperSoft iReport from the link below. JasperSoft iReport v4.6.0 is used in this article.

* [JasperForge iReport](http://jasperforge.org/projects/ireport)

## Download the Treasure Data JDBC Driver

You can download the driver itself from the link below. The driver is still in beta; any feedback is appreciated.

* [JDBC Driver Download](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com/jdbc)

NOTE: This driver only works with Treasure Data. It does not run on other environments, such as your local Hadoop/Hive cluster.

## Add Treasure Data as Data Source

Let's add Treasure Data as Jasper's data source. Please follow the procedure below.

### Step1: Add the JDBC Driver Jar to Classpath

Please go to `Preferences -> iReport Tab -> Classpath`, and press the `Add Jar` button. Select the downloaded JDBC driver and check the `Reloadable` box in the table.

### Step2: Create a New Data Source

Please press the database icon, which is located near the 'Empty datasource' indicator. Add a new data source with type: `Database JDBC connection`.

### Step3: Configure your JDBC Connection

Please configure your jdbc parameters as shown in the following figure. Please make sure to provide your credentials (your email + password).

### Step4: Create Reports

The rest of the step is identical to how you would create reports with a JDBC source.

You would first create a report by going to File -> New -> Report. **Make sure that your data source is configured to be "TreasureData"** (or whatever the name you gave to our JDBC connection).

Here, the query is

	SELECT code, COUNT(1) AS count FROM apache_log GROUP BY code

A few words about this sample data.

1. This table has data from a typical Apache log. The field `code` corresponds to HTTP status code. Essentially, we are counting the number of HTTP requests per status code. 
2. Note that out of the box, Treasure Data has no pre-defined schama. This means that for the above query to work, we need to add schema for the field named `code`.

		$ td table:show demo apache_log
		Name      : demo.apache_log
		Type      : log
		Count     : 25000000
		Schema    : (
		    code:string
		)

	([This page explains](/articles/schema) how to add/remove/modify schema on our system.)

The rest of the setup is exactly the same as any other reports.
