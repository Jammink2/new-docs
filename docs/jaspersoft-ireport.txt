# JasperSoft iReport with JDBC Driver

This article explains how to use Treasure Data with [JasperSoft iReport](http://jasperforge.org/projects/ireport), by leveraging [our JDBC driver](jdbc-driver). By combining Treasure Data with JasperSoft, you can process huge volumes of data on the cloud, while continuing to use your existing JasperSoft instances.

## Download JasperSoft iReport
