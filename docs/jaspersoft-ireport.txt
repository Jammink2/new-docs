# JasperSoft iReport with JDBC Driver

This guide covers how to use Treasure Data with [JasperSoft iReport](http://jasperforge.org/projects/ireport), through [our JDBC driver](jdbc-driver).

## Download JasperSoft iReport

You can download the JasperSoft iReport from here. JasperSoft iReport v4.6.0 is used in this article.

* [JasperForge iReport](http://jasperforge.org/projects/ireport)

## Download JDBC Driver

You can download the driver itself from here. The driver is still in beta quality, so please report to us if you have any problems.

* 2012/06/04: [td-jdbc-0.1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/td-jdbc/td-jdbc-0.1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar)

NOTE: This driver works only with Treasure Data, doesn't work with other environments like your local Hadoop/Hive cluster.
