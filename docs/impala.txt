# Impala Query (Alpha Version)

[Treasure Data](http://treasure-data.com/) is a Hadoop-based Big Data as-a-Service. Treasure Data supports Impala query, which enables low-latency access to the data. This is still an alpha release phase.

## What is Impala?

[Impala](http://github.com/cloudera/impala) is an open-source parallel query execution engine. Unlike Hive, Impala is NOT using MapReduce To avoid latency. Impala directly accesses the data through a specialized distributed query engine that is very similar to those found in commercial parallel RDBMSs.

Treasure Data customized Impala to directly talk with our distributed columnar storage layer, with almost the same user experience from the user's point of view.

## Does Impala replace Hive?

**No**. Hive is designed for batch processing, while Impala is designed for short queries.

Currently, Impala doesn't support fault tolerance within a query. If a node fails in the middle of processing, the whole query has to be re-run. On the other hand, it will run these small queries often 10-50x faster than Hive.

So, even if a node fails and it has to start over from the start, the total runtime will often beat Hive significantly. So, Impala has a big advantage in queries where the runtime is short enough that node failures during the query are unlikely.

There will continue be many viable use cases for MapReduce and Hive (for example, for long-running data transformation workloads).

## How to use Impala?

Please specify `-T impala` for `td query` command. v0.10.85 or newer client is required.

    :::term
    $ td query -w -T impala -d testdb \
      "SELECT code, COUNT(1) FROM www_access GROUP BY code"

For REST API, please specify `type=impala` parameter to `/v3/job/issue/hive/:database` endpoint.

## Known Limitations

We're in an alpha stage of Impala availablity. Compared to Hive, there exists some limitations at this point. These will be improved for the future.

### Lack of UDFs

A lot of Hive UDFs, are NOT available for Impala at this point. This will be resolved at the end of 2013.

### Lack of Complex Types

`map`, `array`, and `struct` are not available at this point.

### JOIN Order

Impala doesn't support cost-based JOIN optimization and disk-based JOIN right now. You must be careful about JOIN manually. The right-hand side of the table must be fitted into the memory at this point, otherwise the query will fail.

    :::sql
    SELECT
      ...
    FROM
      large_table
    JOIN
      small_table

### Schemas are Required

You must set the [Schema](schema)s onto the table, when you want to query via Impala. `v` doesn't work, because Impala doesn't have map type now.

### Limited Time-based Partitioning Capabilities

For [Performance Tuning](performance-tuning), the queries can leverage time-based partitioning of data. While Hive supports a lot of UDFs like TD_TIME_RANGE or TD_TIME_ADD, but Impala doesn't support it now. Please specify POSIX timestamp as an integer within WHERE clause.

    :::sql
    [GOOD]: SELECT field1 FROM tbl WHERE time > 1349393020
    [GOOD]: SELECT field1 FROM tbl WHERE time > 1349393020 + 3600
    [GOOD]: SELECT field1 FROM tbl WHERE time > 1349393020 - 3600
    [BAD]:  SELECT field1 FROM tbl WHERE time > 1349393020.00
    [BAD]:  SELECT field1 FROM tbl WHERE TD_TIME_RANGE(time, "2013-01-01 PDT")
