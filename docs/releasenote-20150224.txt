## Bug Fixes

These is the only important Bug Fix made in this release:

### Console: Update Query Names

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Users cannot update the name of their queries. The drop down does not open.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  This was caused by a CSS misalignment of the drop down control.<br/>
  We fixed the alignment to allow the control to be able to pop the drop down menu open.<br/>
