# Get the API Key

## From Web Console

Please access this <a href="<%= @env[:url_profile] %>">URL</a>. At the right most column, you can retrieve the API key.

There're two types of keys: Normal and Write-Only. The write-only key can only invoke actions with [import only](access-control) permission. This is useful for embedding APIs with SDKs (e.g. [JavaScript](/categories/javascript-sdks), [Mobile](/categories/mobile-sdks), [App](/categories/app-sdks) SDKs).

## From CLI

From [CLI](command-line), please execute the following command.

    :::term
    $ td apikey:show
    YOUR_API_KEY_WILL_BE_HERE
