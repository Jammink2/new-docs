# Get the API Key

## From Web Console

Please access this <a href="https://console.treasuredata.com/users/current">URL</a>. At the right most column, you can retrieve the API key.

There're two types of keys: Normal and Write-Only. The write-only key can only invoke actions with [import only](access-control) permission. This is useful for embedding APIs with [SDKs](/categories/sdks).

## From CLI

From [CLI](command-line), please execute the following command.

    :::term
    $ td apikey:show
    YOUR_API_KEY_WILL_BE_HERE
