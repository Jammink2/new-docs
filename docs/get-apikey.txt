# Get the API Key

## From Web Console

Please access this <a href="<%= @env[:url_profile] %>">URL</a>. You can retrieve the API key from the box at the right hand side.

There're two types of keys: Master and Write only. For more information, please see the [Access Control](access-control#rest-apis-access) page.<br/>
The write only API key is useful when embedding API keys within SDKs (e.g. [JavaScript](javascript-sdk), [Mobile](/categories/mobile-sdks), [App](/categories/app-sdks) SDKs).

## From CLI

At the moment, only the Master API key can be retrieve from the [CLI](command-line).<br/>
To do that, please execute the following command:

    :::term
    $ td apikey:show
    YOUR_API_KEY_WILL_BE_HERE
