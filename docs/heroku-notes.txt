# Heroku Addon Notes

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Ruby, Gems, and Bundler.
  * Basic knowledge of Heroku, including the Heroku toolbelt.
  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data
  * Ruby 1.8 or higher (for local testing).

## 'heroku td', not 'td'

Please use the `heroku td` command instead of the `td` command when on Heroku. The two commands have identical functionality.

## td-agent only works with HTTP

On Heroku, our data import daemon, `td-agent`, works only with HTTP input. This limitation **only exists on Heroku**. You have access to all of `td-agent`'s features when using `td-agent` anywhere else (e.g., your own dedicated server).
