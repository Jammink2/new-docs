# Heroku Addon Notes

Please keep in mind on those points, when you're using Treasure Data, through Heroku addon.

## 'heroku td', not 'td'

Please use `heroku td`, instead of `td`. The list of functions are totally same.

## td-agent works with HTTP only

Our data import daemon, `td-agent`, works only with HTTP input. Please refere [here](/articles/heroku-td-agent). Other articles, which describes about the td-agent doesn't work on Heroku environment. If you have a dedicated data center nodes for td-agent, it works anyway of course.
