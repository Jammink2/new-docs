# Indicee with Treasure Data

[Indicee](http://indicee.com/) is a leading cloud-based BI platform that changes the way people consume data in a fundamental way.

## Combining Indicee and Treasure Data

Indicee and Treasure Data complement each other extremely well.

Treasure Data's strength lies in its ability to store and analyze petabytes of data efficiently. However, it is not best for exploring data interactively because our underlying technology, Hadoop, is designed for batch processing.

Indicee fills in this gap perfectly. Their platform is designed for interactive data analysis and large datasets may pose scalability challenges. By combining Treasure Data's backend with Indicee's frontend, the customer can enjoy beautiful, interactive data analysis at scale.

Let's walk through a typical use case.

## Architecture

This diagram shows a typical architecture for using Treasure Data with Indicee.

First, data is streamed to and archived on Treasure Data. Then, the customer sets up periodic jobs (hourly, daily, etc.). The results of those jobs are written into Indicee.

With your data in Indicee, you are ready to embark on data exploration. You can generate reports and toggle among different visualizations interactively.

## Cube Structure

The key here is how to summarize the data. First, you need to define the "dimentions" along which you want to slice-and-dice and aggreate your data. This structure is also called [CUBE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP_cube).

The dimentions which commonly used are:

* Date
* Gender (Male or Female)
* Age (0-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100...)
* Payment type (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze or Free)

By using these dimentions, you can create a summary dataset on Indicee as follows:

On Treasure Data, creating this table requires just one query with multiple GROUP BYs. One thing to keep in mind is the number of records created on Indicee. For example, with the said four dimentions, there would be 36500 records for one year (= 365 days).
    :::term
    36500 = 365(Date) * 2(Gender) * 10(Age) * 5(Payment)
    
## Basic Usage

### For On-demand Jobs

For on-demand jobs, just add the `-r` option to the `td query` command. The format is like following.

    :::term
     "indicee://<consumerKey>+<tokenKey>:<consumerSecret>+<tokenSecret>@/<dataset>/<contribution>"

After the job is finished, the results are written into `c1` contribution within `ds1` dataset.

    :::sql
    $ td query -r \
      'indicee://<consumerKey>+<tokenKey>:<consumerSecret>+<tokenSecret>@/ds1/c1' \
      -w -d testdb \
      "SELECT gender, age, count(1) FROM payment GROUP BY gender, age"

### For Scheduled Jobs

For scheduled jobs, just add the `-r` option when scheduling a job. Every time the job runs, the results are written into `mytbl`.

    :::term
    $ td result:create ds1 \
      'indicee://<consumerKey>+<tokenKey>:<consumerSecret>+<tokenSecret>@/ds1'
    $ td sched:create hourly_count_example "0 * * * *" \
      -d testdb "SELECT gender, age, count(1) FROM payment GROUP BY gender, age" \
      -r ds1:c1

## Two Ways to Modify Data (Append/Replace)

You can add or delete data in two ways. By using replace mode, you can periodically replace existing contribution with a new query result.

    :::term
    indicee://<consumerKey>+<tokenKey>:<consumerSecret>+<tokenSecret>@/ds1/c1              # append
    indicee://<consumerKey>+<tokenKey>:<consumerSecret>+<tokenSecret>@/ds1/c1?mode=append  # append
    indicee://<consumerKey>+<tokenKey>:<consumerSecret>+<tokenSecret>@/ds1/c1?mode=replace # replace
