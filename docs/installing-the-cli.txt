Installing the Treasure Data CLI
================================

Install the [Treasure Data Toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com/) to set up your local workstation with `td`, the Treasure Data command-line client.

If you are familiar with Ruby, you can install `td` from the command line using `gem`.

    :::term
    $ gem install td

Alternative installation options, including a Mac OSX installer and a Windows installer, can be found on the [Treasure Data Toolbelt page](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com/).
