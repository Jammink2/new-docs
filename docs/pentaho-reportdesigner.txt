# Pentaho Report Designer with JDBC Driver

This article will explain how to use Treasure Data with [Pentaho Business Analytics](http://www.pentaho.com/) using [our JDBC driver](jdbc-driver). By combining Treasure Data with Pentaho, users can process huge volumes of data in the cloud using existing Pentaho instances.

NOTE: This driver works only with Treasure Data. It does not work with other environments such as your local Hadoop/Hive cluster.

## Add Treasure Data as Data Source

Let's add Treasure Data as Pentaho's data source. Please follow the procedure below.

### Step - 1: Add JDBC Driver to Pentaho

Let's copy the Treasure Data JDBC driver to Pentaho's jdbc directory. The command for MacOS environment is shown below.

    :::terminal
    $ cp td-jdbc-VERSION.jar \
      /Applications/pentaho/design-tools/Pentaho\ Report\ Designer.app/lib/jdbc/

### Step - 2: Create New Data Source

Navigate to `Data -> Add Data Source -> Advanced -> JDBC (Custom)`. Create a new data source, click GREEN plus button.

### Step - 4: Create Reports

You can now create reports using generic SQL queries. Open the window from `Data -> Add Datasource -> JDBC` to add Treasure Data as the data source for the report. Once you hit the preview button, the job will start running on the cloud (you can confirm this using the `td jobs` command). You can now design your reports using Treasure Data as your data source.
