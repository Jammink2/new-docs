# IP Whitelist

IP Whitelist can be set for each account but only by an Account Owner or Administrator. It restricts access to one's TD account from a 1 or more IP addresses.

In addition, it is possible for an admin or an Account Owner to set a specific user IP whitelist for a specific account.

## Settings

IP Whitelist can be set from within an Account Owner or Administrator's user [profile page](https://console.treasuredata.com/users/current). The default setting is 'Disabled'.

When enabled, an input form appears where an Account Owner or Administrator can enter one or more IP addresses (and corresponding mask) to grant access to the Console and/or REST APIs. Any address that doesn't match one of the allow addresses will be rejected access to the Console and APIs.

All users in a given account use the account-defaults unless a custom whitelist is specified for that user by an Account Owner or Administrator.

NOTE: Care must be taken in setting up IP Whitelist, as it may bar the user from having any further access to the account.<br/>
If any problem or misconfiguration occurs, please contact our support team at support@treasure-data.com.

## Permissions

Only Administrators and Account Owners can set up IP Whitelist for their own user accounts.<br/>
Additionally, Administrators can modify the whitelists of non-Administrator users but cannot modify whitelists of other Administrator users.<br/>
Account Owners can modify IP whitelists of all users in the account.
Restricted Users cannot modify any whitelists in the account, including their own.
