# Treasure Data JavaScript SDK

This article will help you start sending the data from website to Treasure Data, using our JavaScript SDK library. In this way, you don't have to install anything on your server-side to track the website activities.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of JavaScript / HTML.
  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data.

NOTE: JavaScript SDK is now under the <b>Beta</b> phase. Any feedbacks or bug reports are welcomed.

### Step1: Install the Library

Install the td-js-sdk on your page by copying the JavaScript snippet below and pasting it into your page's `<head>` tag:

    :::html
    <!-- Treasure Data -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
    !function(t,e){if(void 0===e[t]){e[t]=function(){e[t].clients.push(this),this._init=[Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)]},e[t].clients=[];for(var r=function(t){return function(){return this["_"+t]=this["_"+t]||[],this["_"+t].push(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)),this}},s=["addRecord","set","trackEvent","trackPageview","ready"],n=0;n<s.length;n++){var i=s[n];e[t].prototype[i]=r(i)}var a=document.createElement("script");a.type="text/javascript",a.async=!0,a.src=("https:"===document.location.protocol?"https:":"http:")+"//s3.amazonaws.com/td-cdn/sdk/td-1.0.0.js";var c=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];c.parentNode.insertBefore(a,c)}}("Treasure",this);
    </script>

### Step2: Initialize & Send Events to the Cloud

You need to create the `Treasure` client object per database, and track the pageview information by calling `trackPageview()` function.

    :::html
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Configure an instance for your database
      var td = new Treasure({
        writeKey: 'YOUR_WRITE_ONLY_APIKEY_IS_HERE',
        database: 'DATABASE_NAME'
      });
      // track pageview winformation to 'pageviews' table
      td.trackPageview('pageviews');
    </script>

The apikey can be retrieved from the console ([click here](https://console.treasuredata.com/users/current)). It's recommended to use **write-only API key** for SDKs. Each event will fire off asynchronously.

NOTE: IP whitelist won't be applied to any import from JavaScript SDK. Also we've seen a lot of cases where a lot of browsers have an invalid timestamp (like 1970/01/01), so we're currently ignoring the log which has a timestamp older than 7 days, and newer than 3 days ahead.

## Next Steps

For the transparency, we're open sourcing our JavaScript SDK on Github. Please check the repository if necessary. The README contains the full description of JavaScript SDK API. There're some additional APIs to track custom events etc.
