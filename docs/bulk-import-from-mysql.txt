# Bulk Import from MySQL

This article explains how to import data from MySQL to Treasure Data.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including [the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com).
  * Basic knowledge of [Bulk Import](bulk-import)

## Update Bulk Import

First, please make sure you have an up-to-date version of our bulk import program.

    :::term
    $ td import:jar_update
    Installed td-import.jar 0.x.xx into /path/to/.td/java

## Importing data from MySQL

Please execute the following commands to upload the CSV file.

    $ td db:create sampledb
    $ td table:create sampledb sampletbl
    $ td import:auto \
      --format mysql \
      --time-column date_time \
      --db-url jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb \
      --db-user myuser \
      --db-password mypass
      mytable

NOTE: Because `td import:auto` executes the MapReduce jobs to check the invalid rows, it'll take at least <b>1-2 minutes</b>.

In the above command, we assumed that:

* The data file is called `data.csv` and is located in the current directory (hence `./data.csv`)
* The first line indicates column names
* The time field is called "date_time"
* The time format is %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S (You can specify your own with `--time-format`)

For further details, check the [Bulk Import Internals](bulk-import-internal).
