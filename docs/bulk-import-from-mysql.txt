# Bulk Import from MySQL

This article explains how to import data from MySQL to Treasure Data.

## Install Bulk Loader

First, please install the [toolbelt](command-line), which includes bulk loader program, on your computer.

#### Downloads
- [Toolbelt Installer for Windows](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/win)
- [Toolbelt Installer for Mac OS X](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/mac)
- [Toolbelt Installer for Linux](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/linux)

After the installation, `td` command will be installed on your computer. Please open up the terminal, and type `td` to execute the command. Also, please make sure you have `java` as well. Please execute `td import:jar_update` to download the up-to-date version of our bulk loader.

    :::term
    $ td
    usage: td [options] COMMAND [args]
    $ java
    Usage: java [-options] class [args...]
    $ td import:jar_update
    Installed td-import.jar 0.x.xx into /path/to/.td/java

## Importing data from MySQL

Please execute the following commands to upload data from MySQL.

    $ td db:create sampledb
    $ td table:create sampledb sampletbl
    $ td import:auto \
      --format mysql \
      --time-column date_time \
      --db-url jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb \
      --db-user myuser \
      --db-password mypass
      --auto-create sampledb.sampletbl
      mytable

NOTE: Because `td import:auto` executes the MapReduce jobs to check the invalid rows, it'll take at least <b>1-2 minutes</b>.

In the above command, we assumed that:

* The time field is called "date_time"
