# Pentaho Business Analytics with JDBC Driver

This article covers how to use Treasure Data with [Pentaho Business Analytics](http://www.pentaho.com/), through [our JDBC driver](jdbc-driver). By combining Treasure Data with Pentaho, the user can process huge volumes of data on the cloud, while continue using your existing Pentaho instances.

### Step4: Create Reports

Finally you can create the report by arbitrary SQL queries. Open the window from `Data -> Add Datasource -> JDBC` to add the data source for the report. If you hit the preview button, the job starts running on the cloud (You can confirm by `td jobs`). Using this data source, please design your report.
