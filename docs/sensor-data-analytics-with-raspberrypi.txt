# Sensor Data Analytics with Raspberry Pi

[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a credit-card-sized single-board computer. Because it is low-cost and easy to equip with various types of sensors, using Raspberry Pi as a cloud data logger is one of its ideal use cases.

This article introduces how to transport sensor data from Raspberry Pi to Treasure Data.

## Install Raspbian

[Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/) is a free operating system based on Debian, optimized for the Raspberry Pi. Please install Raspbian on your Raspberry Pi by following the instructions in the blog post below:

- [Getting Started with Raspberry Pi: Installing Raspbian](http://www.andrewmunsell.com/blog/getting-started-raspberry-pi-install-raspbian)

## Install Treasure Agent

Next, we'll install Treasure Agent on Raspbian. Raspbian bundles Ruby 1.9.3 by default, but we need the extra development packages.

    :::term
    $ sudo aptitude install ruby-dev

We'll now install Treasure Agent (Fluentd) and the necessary plugins.

    :::term
    $ sudo gem install fluentd
    $ sudo fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-td

## Configure and Launch Treasure Agent

Please sign up to Treasure Data from the [sign up page](https://<%= @env[:console_string] %>/users/sign_up). Its free plan lets you store and analyze millions of data points. You can get your account's API key from the [users page](https://<%= @env[:console_string] %>/users/current).

Please prepare the `td-agent.conf` file with the following information, including your API key.

    :::text
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      apikey YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
 
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /home/pi/td
    </match>
    <source>
      type http
      port 8888
    </source>
    <source>
      type forward
    </source>

Finally, please launch Treasure Agent (Fluentd) via your terminal.

    :::term
    $ fluentd -c fluent.conf

## Upload Test

To test the configuration, just post a JSON message to Treasure Agent via HTTP.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"sensor1":3123.13,"sensor2":321.3}' \
      http://localhost:8888/td.testdb.raspberrypi

NOTE: If you're using Python, you can use <a href="python">python logger</a> library.

Now, access the databases page to confirm that your data has been uploaded to the cloud properly.

* [Treasure Data: List of Databases](https://<%= @env[:console_string] %>/databases)

You can now issue queries against the imported data.

* [Treasure Data: New Query](https://<%= @env[:console_string] %>/query_forms/new)

For example, these queries calculate the average sensor1 value and the sum of sensor2 values.

    :::sql
    SELECT AVG(sensor1) FROM raspberrypi;
    SELECT SUM(sensor2) FROM raspberrypi;

## Conclusion

Raspberry Pi is an ideal platform for prototyping data logger hardware. By combining Raspebrry Pi and Treasure Data, we can easily analyze the phisical world in the cloud.
