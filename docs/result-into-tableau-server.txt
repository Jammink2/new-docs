# Writing Job Results into Tableau Server

Using [Tableau Server](http://www.tableausoftware.com/products/server) with Treasure Data allows users to interactively explore huge amounts of data, and also share the knowledge across multiple people.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data
  * An license and its installation of Tableau Server

## Usage
### CLI: One Time Query

Please add the Tableau result output destination with the <tt>-r</tt> / <tt>--result</tt> option for the `td query` command:

    :::term
    $ td query -d mydb -r 'tableau://username:password@my.tableauserver.com/?mode=replace' 'SELECT * FROM access'

### Console: One Time Query

Please visit the [query editor](http://console.treasuredata.com/query_forms/new) on the web console, and type in the query. The example query below uses the access log example data set, and calculates the distribution of HTTP method per day.

    :::sql
    # HiveQL
    SELECT
      CAST(TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00") AS TIMESTAMP) AS `Datetime`,
      method AS `Method`,
      COUNT(1) AS `Count`
    FROM
      www_access
    GROUP BY
      TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00"),
      method

NOTE: We're casting Datetime column to TIMESTAMP type from String type, for the convenience in the later stages.

Next, please select `Tableau Server` from `Result Export` section. Then the dialog like below will pop up. Please fill with your Tableau Server's username, password, and hostname. Then, please click `Save` button.

- Username: Your Tableau Server Username
- Password: Your Tableau Server Password
- Host: Your Tableau Server Hostname

NOTE: Currently, you <b>MUST</b> setup https (SSL). Please check <a href="http://onlinehelp.tableausoftware.com/v8.2/server/en-us/ssl_config.htm">here</a> about how to set up SSL on your Tableau Server.

Finally, please fill in name of `Datasource` (TDE filename), `Site`, `Project`, and `Mode`. Please visit these URLs to get a list of projects and sites. Let's use `replace` mode for now.

* Datasource: The name of TDE file on Tableau Online
* Site: Please visit the URL `https://<TABLEAU_SERVER_URL>/sites` to get a list of Sites
* Project: Please visit the URL `https://<TABLEAU_SERVER_URL>/t/<YOUR_SITE_NAME>/projects` to get a list of Projects
* Mode: `replace` to replace TDE each time, `append` to append to existing TDE

After filling in all the fields, please `Submit` the query. The system will execute the query, create the TDE (Tableau Data Extract) file, and finally upload TDE to Tableau Server.

Please visit your Tableau Server, and click `Data Sources` section at the top left bar. This will show the list of data sources, and your TDE file should exist there.

By clicking `New Workbook`, you can create the charts and dashboard from the browser. Please drag and drop the dimentions & measures from the left nav, to top right nav to create the graphs. Then please click `Save` to store the result.

### Console: Scheduled Query

In the previous section, you have learned how to create the charts by one job. The next action is to periodically refresh the dataset by [Scheduled Jobs](schedule) feature. By using this feature, you can periodically execute the query on Treasure Data, and update TDE file on Tableau Server. The schedules can be specified from the query editor. One thing it's useful is to use [TD_SCHEDULED_TIME()](udfs#tdscheduledtime) UDF, with `append` mode.

The query below will calculate the # of records within last 24 hours, from the time where the query gets executed. By continuously running this scheduled query, you can avoid processing the entire data set every day.

    :::sql
    # HiveQL
    SELECT
      CAST(TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00") AS TIMESTAMP) AS `Datetime`,
      method AS `Method`,
      COUNT(1) AS `Count`
    FROM
      www_access
    WHERE
      TD_TIME_RANGE(time,
        TD_TIME_ADD(TD_SCHEDULED_TIME(), '-1d'),
        TD_SCHEDULED_TIME())
    GROUP BY
      TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00"),
      method

## Options

Result output to Tableau Server supports various options. The options can be specified
as URL parameters on the CLI or with the REST APIs or the Console where supported.
The options are normally compatible with each other and can be combined.
Where applicable, the default behavior is indicated.

### <tt>ssl</tt>

The **ssl** option determines whether to use SSL or not for connecting to the Tableau server.
When 'true', SSL is used. <tt>ssl=true</tt> is the default when this option is not
specified.

    :::term
    tableau://username:password@my.tableauserver.com/?ssl=true

### <tt>ssl_verify</tt>

The **ssl_verify** option determines whether to require certifcate verification
for the SSL communication or not.
When 'true', the certificate verification is required. <tt>ssl_verify=true</tt>
is the default when this option is not specified.

    :::term
    tableau://username:password@my.tableauserver.com/?ssl=true&ssl_verify=true

Disabling certificate verification is particularly useful when the Tableau server's SSL certificate
is **self-signed**.
