## Bug Fixes

These are the most important Bug Fixes made in this release:

### Console: Manual Schedule Runs

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Running a schedule manually allows the creation of multiple job at the same time.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  There is no limitations on how many times the 'Run Manually' Submit button can be pressed. Each button press spawns a new job with the schedule time specified.<br/>
  The Submit button is de-bounced, only one form submission is allowed until a job is completely submitted.<br/>

### Console: Top Bar Menu Hovering In/Out

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  On the Safari web browser, the Top Bar Help menu renders a flash-like visual affect when hovering in/out. Furthermore the mouse pointer changes unexpectedly when transitioning.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  This is due to the aliasing effects on Safari and to not controlling the mouse pointer style when hovering in/out.<br/>
  Forced the mouse pointer style to 'cursor' and fixed the aliasing of the fonts.<br/>
