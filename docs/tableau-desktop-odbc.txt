## Prerequisites

Please setup ODBC driver and Tableau before trying the following steps.

- Windows 7, 8.1, or later
- Tableau Desktop 8.2

## Install ODBC Driver

Please install Treasure Data [ODBC Driver](odbc-driver), and register to your machine. We'll assume you have DSN (Data Source Name) as `Treasure Data` in the following sections.

## Establish ODBC Connection

Please launch Tableau, and select `Connect to Data` first.

- Server: <%= @env[:pggw_endpoint] %>
- Port: 5439
- Database: public
- Username: **YOUR_EMAIL**
- Password: **YOUR_PASSWORD**

### Select table and database on TreasureData

Please remain Database as `Public`, and select the database name in Treasure Data at `Schema` section. We know it's a bit confusing :(

![Set database](/images/tableau-desktop-4.png "Set database") 

Next, please select the table name in Treasure Data, and click `Go to Worksheet`.

![Set Table](/images/tableau-desktop-5.png "Set Table")

## Tips and Tricks

### Convert time Field as Datetime Type

Treasure Data treats `time` column as unix timestamp by default, howevery it's really convenient to handle timestamp with `Datetime` type on Tableau. To make the things easy, this section describes how to create the calculated Datetime field for "time" column.

![select time](/images/tableau-desktop-7.png "select time")

Select `Creat Calculated Field...`

![select calc field](/images/tableau-desktop-8.png "select calc field")

Then, please put the name, put the following function within `Formula` section.

```sql
RAWSQL_DATETIME("from_unixtime(%1)", [time])
```

![set calc field](/images/tableau-desktop-9.png "set calc field")

After that, the calculated field appiers in a list of Dimensions, with Datetime type.

![Set t](/images/tableau-desktop-10.png "Set t")
