# Support Channels

## Documentation

We have tried to cover the following areas with our documentation:

  * Basic use cases of Treasure Data
  * Some of our important advanced features
  * Areas that have confused our users in the past

However, we understand that no documentation can cover everything our users need. That's why we've set up Support Desk and Mail channels for you to communicate with us.

## Email

This is the most common way of submitting the support inquiry. Please send us an email at `<%= @env[:mail_support] %>`.

## Support Desk

You can submit tickets to our Support Desk at [help.treasuredata.com](http://help.treasuredata.com/). Communicate directly with our support team and receive email updates on your tickets. We usually reply within a few business days.

## More Support Options

Paying customers have access to higher levels of support and faster support response times. Please [contact us](<%= @env[:url_contact] %>) for more information.
