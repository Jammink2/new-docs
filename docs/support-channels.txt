# Support Channels

## Documentation

We have tried to cover the following areas with our documentation:

  * Basic use cases of Treasure Data
  * Some of our important advanced features
  * Areas that have confused our users in the past

However, we understand that no documentation can cover everything our users need. That's why we've set up Support Desk and Mail channels for you to communicate with us.

## Support Desk

You can submit tickets to our Support Desk at [help.treasure-data.com](http://help.treasure-data.com/discussions). Communicate directly with our support team and receive email updates on your tickets. We usually reply within a few business days.

## Mail

For issues that do not fit into the above categories, please send us an email at `support@treasure-data.com`.
