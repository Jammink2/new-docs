# Bulk Import Tips and Tricks

This article describes some tips and tricks for bulk import.

## How to use a proxy server

If you cannot upload, please first check if your network is using a proxy. You can set the proxy by setting the environment variables:

    :::terminal
    # Windows:
    $ set HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy_host:8080
    # Other:
    $ export HTTP_PROXY="proxy_host:8080"

## How to increase performance through parallelism

`td import:auto` supports two options to tune parallelism: <tt>\-\-parallel</tt> and <tt>\-\-prepare-parallel</tt>.

    :::terminal
    --parallel NUM                   upload in parallel (default: 2; max 8)
    --prepare-parallel NUM           prepare in parallel (default: 2; max 96)

<tt>\-\-parallel</tt> specifies how many threads are to be used for uploading the data. If you observe that the bulk import tool is not saturating your network, you can increase the value of the <tt>\-\-parallel</tt> option.

<tt>\-\-prepare-parallel</tt> specifies the number of threads are to be used to compress the data locally. Normally, this number should match the number of CPU cores on your machine.

## How to specify time column for maximum query performance

Please don't specify '<tt>0</tt>' if you don't have a time column. Treasure Data partitions the data by time by default (See [Data Partitioning](data-partitioning)). 
It's recommended to always specify the time column, or specify the current time.


## How to select Enable/Disable auto jar_update

The option to select Enable/Disable auto jar_update can be included in td v0.11.2 and later versions

An environment variable hook: TD_TOOLBELT_JAR_UPDATE.
  
#### JAR auto-update is enabled by default or enabled if the variable is 1:

    :::terminal
    $ td import:prepare
    $ TD_TOOLBELT_JAR_UPDATE=1 td import:prepare

#### JAR auto-update is disabled then variable is set to 0:

    :::terminal
    $ TD_TOOLBELT_JAR_UPDATE=0 td import:prepare

but this setting does not affect td import:jar_update, which always updates the JAR file.

## How to confirm Time Zone
The bulk import tool use a TZ environment variable. If you think your bulk import time zone is wrong, please check your TZ environment variable.

## How to encode Shift_JIS
When you encode shift_jis you should set encoding option to '-e Windows-31J'.
