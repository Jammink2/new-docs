# Bulk Import Tips and Tricks

This article describes some tips and tricks around the bulk improt.

## Using the proxy server

If you cannot upload, please first check if your network is using proxy. You can set proxy by setting the environment variables:

    :::term
    # Windows:
    $ set HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy_host:8080
    # Other:
    $ export HTTP_PROXY="proxy_host:8080"

## Increase performance through parallelism

`td import:auto` supports two options to tune parallelism: <tt>\-\-parallel</tt> and <tt>\-\-prepare-parallel</tt>.

    :::term
    --parallel NUM                   upload in parallel (default: 2; max 8)
    --prepare-parallel NUM           prepare in parallel (default: 2; max 96)

<tt>\-\-parallel</tt> option specifies how many threads to be used for uploading the data. If you observe bulk import tool is not saturating your network, please consider increasing the value of the <tt>\-\-parallel</tt> option.

<tt>\-\-prepare-parallel</tt> option specifies the number of threads to be used to compress the data locally. Normally this number should match the number of CPU cores on your machine.

## Specify time column for maximum query performance

Please don't specify '<tt>0</tt>' if you don't have time column. Treasure Data is partitioning the data by time by default (See [Data Partitioning](data-partitioning)). It's recommended to always specify the time column, or specify the current time.
