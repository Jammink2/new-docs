# Bulk Import Tips and Tricks

This article describes some tips and tricks around the bulk improt.

## Using the proxy server

If you cannot upload, please first check if your network is using proxy. You can set proxy by setting the environment variables.

    :::term
    e.g.
    Windows:
    $ set HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy_host:8080
    Other:
    $ export HTTP_PROXY="proxy_host:8080"


## Perforamnce increase by more parallelism

`td import:auto` supports two options to tune the parallelism: `--parallel` and `--prepare-parallel`.

    :::term
    --parallel NUM                   upload in parallel (default: 2; max 8)
    --prepare-parallel NUM           prepare in parallel (default: 2; max 96)

`--parallel` option specifies how many threads to be used for uploading the data. If you observe bulk import tool is not saturating your network, please consider having `--parallel` option with higher numbers.

`--prepare-parallel` option specifies the number of threads to be used to compress the data locally. Normally this number should match your number of CPU cores or more.

## Specify time column for maximum query performance

Please don't specify `0` if you don't have time column. Treasure Data is partitioning the data by time by default (See [Data Partitioning](data-partitioning)). It's recommended to always specify the time column, or specify the current time.
