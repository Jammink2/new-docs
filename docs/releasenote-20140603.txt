<br/>
### Console: Treasure Agent Monitoring Service (Public Beta)

We are excited to announce the Public release of the Treasure Agent Monitoring Service. By adding a simple to deploy plugin, users can track the status of their `td-agent` (Treasure Agent daemon) on the Console and monitor its performance.

We have also added notifications to allow the user to get an email when any of their monitored `td-agent` instances goes down for more than 5 minutes.

For more information, please visit the [Treasure Agent Monitoring Service (TAMS)](treasure-agent-monitoring-service) documentation page.

## Bug Fixes

This the only important Bug Fix made in this release:

### Console: Edit as New Query

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  "Edit as New Query" for a job with an unsaved output target containing a password sets the password wrongly when saving the job as Schedule.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  When saving to a Schedule the original job unnamed output target's password was not retrieved from the database.<br/>

<br/>
### Console: Manual Schedule Runs

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Date-time used when manually triggering a job for a Schedule query does not match the date-time selected.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  The problem was due to the date-time picker in the Schedule view.<br/>
  The date-time picker has been changed to a stock AngularJS-bootstrapped one and fixed.<br/>

<br/>
### Console: CPU Core Utilization

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  The CPU core utilization chart may show non-zero utilization even when the system is not used.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  Since 0 CPU utilization data points are not logged, non-zero utilization points were connected by a line inducing the observer into thinking the utilization was non-zero during the times in between the non-zero data points.<br/>
  Fixed the visualization by inserting zeros for all points where the CPU utilization is expected to be 0.<br/>

<br/>
### APIs: Schema Auto-Detection on Import

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Schema auto-detection can fail to detect sparse columns (columns with elements in a very small subset of the records).<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  Schema auto-detection is performed only on the records stored in the tail but only a small portion (40) of the records imported is stored in the tail. The tail may happen to contain none of the records with elements from the sparse columns.<br/>
  Schema auto-detection is extended to be performed on **all** records imported.<br/>

<br/>
### APIs: Manual Schedule Runs and Timezone Changes

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Manual run requests for Schedules whose timezone of reference has been modified fail with a 500 (Internal Server) error.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  This was caused by a mishandling of long-form (Tokyo, Los Angeles, etc...) timezone specifiers.<br/>
  Now all timezones are referred back to their unique numeric identifier for handling consistency.<br/>

<br/>
### Backend: Handling of Hive's Semantic Error

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Hive queries retries (12 times, up to 1 hour) on Semantic error exceptions.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  Semantic error exceptions are not included in the list of unrecoverable error codes for Hive.<br/>
  Unrecoverable errors are those deterministic errors, errors whose result won't change if retried.<br/>

<br/>
### Worker: Data Exporting

* _**[Problem]**_<br/>
  Exporting data from Treasure Data to AWS S3 can cause Null Pointer Exceptions.<br/>
  _**[Solution]**_<br/>
  This was due to having keys with _nil_ values in the parameters hash map when constructing an error message.<br/>
  Replacing the value of _nil_ keys with the string "<tt>null</tt>".<br/>
