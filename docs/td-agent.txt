# Continuous Data Import with td-agent

This guide covers how to continuously import the data with 'td-agent' daemon.

## Logs Are Streams, Not Files

The logs are usually roteted by time or size per hourly/daily basis, and the rotation generates the big files. To analyze these logs, these files are imported in batch-style. However, we believe that the logs are the continuously generated *STREAM*, not files in nature.

NOTE: Server daemons and applications sometimes offer a configuration parameter for a path to the programâ€™s logfile. This can lead us to think of logs as files. But a better conceptual model is to treat logs as time-ordered streams. - <a href="http://adam.heroku.com/past/2011/4/1/logs_are_streams_not_files/">Logs Are Streams, Not Files</a> by Adam Wiggins, Heroku

To continuously import the data into Treasure Data, we're providing the data aggregation daemon called 'td-agent' for this purpose. Although bulk imported is also supported, continuous importing via td-agent is highly recommended.

## About td-agent

td-agent is a data collection daemon. It collects or receives logs from various data sources, and upload to Treasure Data.

NOTE: td-agent is fully open-sourced as <a href="https://github.com/fluent/fluentd">fluentd project</a> on the github. td-agent is just the package which contains fluentd, with some extension plugins for Treasure Data.

## Install td-agent

Please consult the following articles to setup it.

## Setup td-agent

After installing td-agent, you may modify your config file. It's installed at /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf.

The file includes some sample settings. Please open the file and find the following lines:

    :::term
    # HTTP input
    <source>
      type http
      port 8888
    </source>
    
    # Treasure Data output
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      apikey ...
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
    </match>

You need to set the `apikey` option, which is a secret key to authenticate your account. Please copy the apikey from ~/.td/td.conf file:

    :::term
    $ grep apikey ~/.td/td.conf
    apikey = 1be3de7d01be3de7d01be3de7d01be3de7d01be3

Now please restart the td-agent service.

    :::term
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

### Confirm Data Upload

You can add logs using send JSON data using HTTP.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"action":"login","user":2}' \
      http://localhost:8888/td.testdb.www_access

td-agent continuously uploads logs every 1 minute. By sending SIGUSR1 signal, td-agent flushes the buffered logs into the cloud.

    :::term
    $ sudo killall -SIGUSR1 td-agent

You can confirm that the data import by using `td tables`:

    :::term
    $ td tables
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | Database   | Table      | Type | Count     |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | testdb     | www_access | log  | 1         |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+

If you have any trouble, please look at /var/log/td-agent.log for further investigation.
