# Data Import from Rails Applications

'[td-logger-ruby](http://github.com/treasure-data/td-logger-ruby)' is used to import data from Rails applications to Treasure Data. 

This article explains how to use the td-logger-ruby library.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Ruby, Rails, Gems, and Bundler.
  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including [the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com).
  * Ruby 1.8 or higher (for local testing).

NOTE: The <a href="/articles/heroku-rails">Rails Apps on Heroku</a> explains how to use Rails applications on Heroku, and <a href="/articles/engine-yard-rails">Rails Apps on EngineYard</a> explains it on EngineYard.

## Installing td-agent

td-logger-ruby requires 'td-agent' to be installed on your application servers. td-agent is a daemon program dedicated to the continuous upload of any kind of streaming log data. td-agent is developed and maintained by Treasure Data, Inc.

The [td-logger-ruby](http://github.com/treasure-data/td-logger-ruby) library enables Rails applications to post records to their local td-agent. td-agent in turn uploads the data to the cloud every 5 minutes. Because the daemon runs on a local node, the logging latency is negligible.

To set up td-agent, please refer to the following articles; we provide deb/rpm packages for Linux systems.

  </tr>
</table>

NOTE: td-agent is fully open-sourced under the <a href="http://fluentd.org/">fluentd project</a>. td-agent extends fluentd with custom plugins for Treasure Data.

## Modifying /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf

Next, please specify your authentication key by setting the `apikey` option. You can view your api key with the *td apikey:show* command.

Note: You must first authenticate your account using the ‘td account’ command.

    :::term
    $ td apikey:show
    3b7118fd3ad7e35bbd3c0e4f607ec7263aa93c30

Next, please set the `apikey` option in your td-agent.conf file. 

Note: *YOUR_API_KEY* should be your actual apikey string.

    :::text
    # Treasure Data Input and Output
    <source>
      type forward
      port 24224
    </source>
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      apikey YOUR_API_KEY
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
      use_ssl true
    </match>

Please restart your agent once these lines are in place.

    :::term
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

td-agent will now accept data via port 24224, buffer it (*var/log/td-agent/buffer/td*), and automatically upload it into the cloud.

## Using td-logger-ruby

First, add the ‘td’ gem to your Gemfile.

    :::ruby
    gem 'td', "~> 0.10.6"

Next, modify the *config/treasure_data.yml* file as follows.

    :::yaml
    production:
      agent: "localhost:24224"
      tag: td.production_database_name
      debug_mode: false
    
    development:
      agent: "localhost:24224"
      tag: td.development_database_name
      debug_mode: false
    
    test:
  
Finally, insert the appropriate logging code into your application.

    :::ruby
    # Example1: login event
    TD.event.post('login', {:uid=>123})
    
    # Example2: follow event
    TD.event.post('follow', {:uid=>123, :from=>'TD', :to=>'Heroku'})
    
    # Example3: pay event
    TD.event.post('pay',
                  {:uid=>123, :item_name=>'Stone of Jordan',
                   :category=>'ring', :price=>100, :count=>1})

## Confirming Data Import

Sending a SIGUSR1 signal will flush td-agent's buffer; upload will start immediately.

    :::term
    $ ruby test.rb
    $ kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/td-agent/td-agent.pid`

To confirm that your data has been uploaded successfully, issue the *td tables* command as shown below.

    :::term
    $ td tables
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | Database   | Table      | Type | Count     |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | test_db    | login      | log  | 1         |
    | test_db    | follow     | log  | 1         |
    | test_db    | pay        | log  | 1         |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+

## Production Deployments

### Use Rack-based Server Deployments

We recommend that you use *unicorn*, *thin*, *mongrel*, etc. Other setups have not been fully validated.

### High-Availablability Configurations of td-agent

For high-traffic websites (more than 5 application nodes), we recommend using a high availability configuration of td-agent. This will improve data transfer reliability and query performance.

* [High-Availability Configurations of td-agent](td-agent-high-availability)

### Monitoring td-agent

Monitoring td-agent itself is also important. Please refer this document about general monitoring methods for td-agent.

* [Monitoring td-agent](td-agent-monitoring)

## Next Steps

We offer a schema mechanism that is more flexible than that of traditional RDBMSs. For queries, we leverage the Hive Query Language.
