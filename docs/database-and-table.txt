# Database and Table Management

Treasure Data uses the same convention as Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) for managing data sets: *Databases* and *Tables*. Each database can contain several tables. However, each table can only belong to one database.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data.

## Database and Table

A *Database* is a collection of tables, which is similar to other database systems.
*Tables* contain your actual data. A given table can only belong to a single database.

## Management from Web Console

[Databases](<%= @env[:url_databases] %>) page allows you to navigate/create/delete databases and tables from the browser. This is the preferred way to interact with databases and tables.

## Management from Command Line Interface (CLI)

By using the [toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com), you can manage databases and tables from the command line.

### Creating a Database

The 'db:create' sub-command creates a database. For example, the following command will create a table named 'test_db' on the cloud.

    :::term
    $ td db:create test_db

NOTE: The database name only supports alphanumeric characters and underscores. Hyphens cannot be used (an exception will be thrown). Also, the database name must be 3 to 256 characters long.

Your local environment remains unchanged; the database resides solely on the cloud.

### A List of Your Databases

The 'dbs' sub-command lists all the databases in your account.

    :::term
    $ td dbs
    +---------------+
    | Name          |
    +---------------+
    | twitter       |
    | follow_events |
    | test_db       |
    +---------------+
    3 rows in set

### Removing a Database

The 'db:delete' sub-command removes a database. This will remove all tables and all data stored within the database as well.

    :::term
    $ td db:delete test_db
    Database 'test_db' is deleted.

NOTE: This operation cannot be rolled back. The data will be unrecoverable.

### Creating a Table

The 'table:create' sub-command creates a table. For example, the following command will create a table named 'test_table' within the database 'test_db'.

    :::term
    $ td table:create test_db test_table
    Table 'test_db.test_table' is created.

NOTE: The table name only supports alphanumeric characters and underscores. Hyphens cannot be used (an exception will be thrown). Also, the table name must be 3 to 256 characters long.

Much like your database, this table only exists on the cloud. Your local environment remains unchanged.

### A List of Your Tables

The 'tables' sub-command lists all the tables within the specified database. The number of records in each table will be shown as well (currently zero).

    :::term
    $ td tables test_db
    +----------+------------+------+-------+
    | Database | Table      | Type | Count |
    +----------+------------+------+-------+
    | test_db  | test_table | log  | 0     |
    +----------+------------+------+-------+
    1 row in set

Issuing the 'tables' command without an argument will list all the databases and tables that you have created.

    :::term
    $ td tables
    +----------+-------------+------+-------------+
    | Database | Table       | Type | Count       |
    +----------+-------------+------+-------------+
    | kzk      | www_access  | log  | 14          |
    | sf       | ab          | log  | 212900645   |
    | sf       | msgpack_www | log  | 390734      |
    | sf       | wikistats3  | log  | 12745020396 |
    | sf       | x           | log  | 3           |
    | test_db  | test_table  | log  | 0           |
    +----------+-------------+------+-------------+
    8 rows in set

### Drop Table

The 'table:delete' sub-command removes a table from a database. This will remove all data stored within the table as well.

    :::term
    $ td table:delete test_db test_table
    Table 'test_db.test_table' is deleted.

NOTE: This operation cannot be rolled back. The data will be unrecoverable.

### Expire Data From A Table

Data expiration is a mechanism that allows the user to set an expiration period (in days) for the data in a table.
When an expiration period is set for a specific table, all records in that table whose timestamp is older than the amount of days specified in the expiration period, will be dropped.

Internally, the feature does not consist in actually deleting/dropping the expired records from the table;
the records are only flagged as expired and will no longer be able to be queried. As such, when table expiration is
disabled for a table, all the records previously expired from a table will be available for querying again.
One big advantage of this is that data expiration will take effect immediately after the expiration period is set for the table.

NOTE: Currently only the Hive and Pig engines can honor table expiration.<br/>
The Presto engine will instead return all records according to the query indifferently on what table expiration settings the table has set on.

Since at this stage this feature is to be considered experimental it is not available by default. It needs to be enabled
on an account per account basis. Please contact us through the support channels listed at the bottom of this page if you
would like this feature enabled for your account.

After table data expiration is enabled for the account, to set the expiration period (days) for a table one can use:

#### CLI

To enable and set the expiration:

    :::term
    $ td table:expire test_db test_table expiration_days

where expiration_days is an integer number greater than 0 for the expiration period length.<br/>
To disable the table data expiration simply set the expiration days to 0:

    :::term
    $ td table:expire test_db test_table 0

#### Console

Access the database page and then table page from within the Console. Once there, click on the 'Table Settings' button.

![Console's Table Settings](/images/console_table_expiration.png)

To enable table data expiration from the table settings page, switch the 'Expire data?' field to 'Yes', then set the 'Expire data after' field underneath to the desired number of days. Finally click on the 'Update Table' button at the bottom of the page.
