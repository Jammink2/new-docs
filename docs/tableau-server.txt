# Tableau Server with Treasure Data

Using [Tableau Server](http://www.tableausoftware.com/products/server) with Treasure Data allows users to interactively explore huge amounts of data, and also share the dashboards with other people.

Currently, Treasure Data supports [Result Output to Tableau Server](result-into-tableau-server). By using this, you can push the query result to Tableau Server as a [TDE](http://kb.tableausoftware.com/articles/knowledgebase/working-with-tableau-data-extracts) (Tableau Data Extract). You can store large amount of data into Treasure Data, then aggregate it, and publish to Tableau Server.
