# Bulk Import from Databases

This article explains how dump data from a several popular databases and importing them into Treasure Data. The process is as follows:

1) Depending on your database, export your desired tables into a file (see below).

2) Use the [Bulk Import](bulk-import) feature to import the file into Treasure Data.

## MySQL
From the MySQL shell, use something like the following to export to a CSV file:
    :::sql
    SELECT * 
    INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/result.csv'
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    ENCLOSED BY '"'
    ESCAPED BY ‘\\’
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
    FROM users

## PostgresSQL
Use `copy` to export a table from Postgres to a CSV file. For example:

    :::term
    COPY users TO '/tmp/result.csv' DELIMITER ','

For more information see the [Postgres documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-copy.html).

## MongoDB
Use the `mongoexport` command to export a collection into CSV or JSON format. For example:

    :::term
    $ mongoexport --db users --collection contacts --csv --out /tmp/result.csv

For more information, see the [MongoDB documentation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongoexport/).
