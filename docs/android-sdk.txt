# Treasure Data Android SDK

This article will help you start sending the data from your Android app to Treasure Data, using our Android SDK library. In this way, you don't have to install anything on your server-side to track the mobile app activities.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Android Development
  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data.

NOTE: Android SDK is now under the <b>Beta</b> phase. Any feedbacks or bug reports are welcomed.

## Step 1: Install the Library

#### Maven

If you use maven, add the following directives to your `pom.xml` under `<dependencies>`. `pom.xml` in [an example Android application project](https://github.com/treasure-data/td-android-sdk/blob/master/example/td-android-sdk-demo/pom.xml) could be a good reference.

    :::xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.treasuredata</groupId>
      <artifactId>td-android-sdk</artifactId>
      <version>0.1.0</version>
    </dependency>

#### Jar File

If you don't use Maven, please put [td-android-sdk-x.x.x.jar](http://search.maven.org/#browse%7C606603944) into (YOUR_ANDROID_PROJECT)/libs.

## Step 2: Initialize the Library

### Enable Required Android Permissions

If it’s not already present, add the INTERNET permission to your AndroidManifest.xml file. The entry below should appear between the `<manifest> .. </manifest>` tags. The example is [here](https://github.com/treasure-data/td-android-sdk/blob/master/example/td-android-sdk-demo/AndroidManifest.xml#L10).

    :::xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

### Create Client

Create the `TreasureData` object with your API key. The recommended place to do this is in the `onCreate()` method of your main activity. Here’s some example code:

    :::java
    public class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
      private TreasureData td;

      @Override
      protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        td = new TreasureData(this, "YOUR_API_KEY");
        ...
      }
    }

The apikey can be retrieved from the console ([click here](https://console.treasuredata.com/users/current)). It's recommended to use **write-only API key** for SDKs.

## Step 3: Send Events to the Cloud

Next, please call addEvent() function at the appropriate timing within your applications. This example sends the event to table `table_b` within database `database_a`, when the button was clicked.

    :::java
    View v = findViewById(R.id.button);
    v.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
      @Override
      public void onClick(View v) {
        final Map event = new HashMap<String, Object>();
        event.put("name", "foo bar");
        event.put("age", 42);
        event.put("comment", "hello world");
        td.addEvent("database_a", "table_b", event);
      }
    });

By default, all events will be bufferred to the file. You **need to explicitly flush** the bufferred data to the cloud. It won't be uploaded automatically.

The following code uploads the event when your application goes to the background. You can do this whenever you like. The uploader doesn't block the main UI thread.

    :::java
    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
      td.uploadEvents();
      super.onPause();
    }

You can handle errors of addEvent() or uploadEvents() by the callback function.

    :::java
    td.setUploadEventsCallBack(new TDCallback() {
      @Override
      public void onSuccess() {
        Log.i("Example", "success!");
      }

      @Override
      public void onError(Exception e) {
        Log.w("Example", "error: " + e.toString());
      }
    });
