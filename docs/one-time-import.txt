# One-Time Import

This article explains how to import data with the `td table:import` command.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including [the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com).

## Three Categories of Import

#### 1) Streaming Import

The import for continuously generated data. In this case, [td-agent](td-agent) article is more appropriate.

#### 2) Bulk Import

The import for huge amounts of data, which could cause a network transfer failure between your side and Treasure Data. In this case, [Bulk Import](bulk-import) article is more appropriate, because it supports the multi-part upload, data validations, and the transactional commit. But it has additional steps.

#### 3) One-Time Import

The import for importing small amount of data, usually stored within one file, which rarely causes the transfer failrue. In this case, please proceed the following sections.

## The *td table:import* Command

For one-time import, please use `td table:import` command. The command takes the file path and format as arguments, and uploads the data into the cloud. It currently supports the following formats.

### JSON

In order to use JSON, the files should be formatted as follows:

* One JSON-map per line. 
* A `time` field is required. This field indicates the time in which the event was generated.

The example entries are like this:

    :::term
    {"action":"login","user":2,"time":"2011-08-02 03:06:32 +0900"}
    {"action":"login","user":4,"time":"2011-08-02 03:06:32 +0900"}
    {"action":"login","user":0,"time":"2011-08-02 03:06:32 +0900"}
    ...

You can import your data into the `test_table` table within your `test_db` database as follows.

    :::term
    $ td table:import test_db test_table \
      --format json \
      --time-key time \
      file1.json file2.json

### Apache Log

The `td table:import` command can also parse Apache Logs stored in the 'combined' format. The command automatically splits the log records into meaningful fields (ex: time, user-agent, etc.) and imports the data into the cloud.

    :::term
    $ td table:import test_db test_table --format apache access_log.txt

### Syslog

The `td table:import` command can also parse logs stored in the 'syslog' format.

    :::term
    $ td table:import test_db test_table --format syslog syslog.txt
