# One-Time Import

This article explains how to import data using the `td table:import` command.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including [the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com).

## Why One-Time Import?
If you want to import a small amount of data (perhaps only a few files with small sizes) one-time import is a quick way to do so. This method doesn't use MessagePack compression and doesn't retry if there is a network failure during transfer. If a more reliable method is desired, please use [Bulk Import](bulk-import). 

## The *td table:import* Command

To perform one-time import, please use the `td table:import` command. This command takes the file path and data format as arguments and uploads the data into the cloud. It currently supports the following data formats.

### JSON

In order to perform one-time import with the JSON data format option, the files should be formatted as follows:

* One JSON-map per line. 
* A `time` field is required. This field indicates the time in which the event was generated.

For example, entries could be formatted as follows:

    :::term
    {"action":"login","user":2,"time":"2011-08-02 03:06:32 +0900"}
    {"action":"login","user":4,"time":"2011-08-02 03:06:32 +0900"}
    {"action":"login","user":0,"time":"2011-08-02 03:06:32 +0900"}
    ...

You can import your data into the `test_table` table within your `test_db` database as follows.

    :::term
    $ td table:import test_db test_table \
      --format json \
      --time-key time \
      file1.json file2.json

### Apache Log

The `td table:import` command can also parse Apache Logs stored in the 'combined' format. The command automatically splits the log records into meaningful fields (ex: time, user-agent, etc.) and imports the data into the cloud.

    :::term
    $ td table:import test_db test_table --format apache access_log.txt

### Syslog

The `td table:import` command can also parse logs stored in the 'syslog' format.

    :::term
    $ td table:import test_db test_table --format syslog syslog.txt
