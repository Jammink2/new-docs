# Data Partitioning

Once you store the data into Treasure Data, all the data is partitioned based on their timestamp. More specifically, our data store automatically partitions the data with hourly basis.

Threfore, you can avoid processing the whole dataset by having the constraints for 'time' column. This will give you a better performance.

    :::sql
    SELECT COUNT(1) FROM table WHERE time > 1338311795
