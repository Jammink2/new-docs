# Data Partitioning

Once your data is stored in Treasure Data, it is partitioned according to its timestamps. Your data is partitioned by the hour.

By constraining the 'time' column, you can avoid processing the whole dataset. This results in better performance.

    :::sql
    SELECT COUNT(1) FROM table WHERE time > 1338311795
