# Deletion

This article explains how to delete your imported data by using the `td table:partial_delete` command.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including the [toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com).

## Deletion

The `td table:partial_delete` command lets you delete your imported data within a specific table by specifying the time range. Please note that because the stored data is partitioned per hour, the arguments for `--from` and `--to` must be divided by 3600 (1 hour).

    :::term
    $ td help table:partial_delete
    usage:
      $ td table:partial_delete <db> <table>

    example:
      $ td table:partial_delete example_db table1 --from 1341000000 --to 1341003600

    description:
      Delete logs from the table within the specified time range

    options:
      -t, --to TIME                    end time of logs to delete in Unix time multiple of 3600 (1 hour)
                                         or Ruby time string format (e.g. '2014-07-01 14:00:00 JST') where
                                         the minutes and seconds are required to be 0.
      -f, --from TIME                  start time of logs to delete in Unix time multiple of 3600 (1 hour)
                                         or Ruby time string format (e.g. '2014-07-01 13:00:00 JST') where
                                         the minutes and seconds are required to be 0.
      -w, --wait                       wait for the job to finish

The data deletion is executed as a `job`. This means that you can confirm its status by issuing the `td jobs` command (see [Job Management](job)). The `-w` option lets you wait until the job is finished.
