# Deletion

This article explains how to delete already imported data with `td table:partial_delete` command.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including [the toolbelt](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com).

## Deletion

`td table:partial_delete` command lets you delete already imported data within a specific table, by specifying the time range. There's one limitation here. Because the stored data is partitioned per hour, the arguments given by `--from` and `--to` must be devided by 3600 (1 hour).

    $ td table:partial_delete --help
    usage:
      $ td table:partial_delete <db> <table>
    
    example:
      $ td table:partial_delete example_db table1 --from 1341000000 --to 1341003600
    
    description:
      Delete logs from the table within the specified time range
    
    options:
      -t, --to TIME                    end time of logs to delete
      -f, --from TIME                  start time of logs to delete
      -w, --wait                       wait for finishing the job

The deletion is executed as `job`, so you can confirm the status by `td jobs` command. `-w` option let you wait until the job completion.
