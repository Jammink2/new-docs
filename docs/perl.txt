# Data Import from Perl Applications

In order to import data from Perl applications to Treasure Data, we provide a logger library called '[fluent-logger-perl](http://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-perl)'. This article describes how to use that library.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Perl and CPAN
  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data, including the latest installed version of the toolbelt.
  * An installed version of Perl 5.10 or higher to test locally

## Install the td-agent

At first, you need to setup 'td-agent' on your application servers. ‘td-agent’ is a daemon program dedicated to the continuous upload of any kind of streaming log data. td-agent is developed and maintained by Treasure Data, Inc.

Through [fluent-logger-perl](http://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-perl) library, Perl applications can post their application logs to local td-agent, and it uploads to the cloud every 5 minutes. Because the daemon runs on a local node, the logging latency is negligible.

Please refer to the following articles in setting up td-agent. For Linux systems, we're providing deb/rpm packages for the easy installation.

    <th>Please look at...</th>

  </tr>
</table>

NOTE: Please note that td-agent is fully open-sourced as the <a href="http://github.com/fluent/">fluentd project</a>. td-agent is a package which contains fluentd and extension plugins for Treasure Data.

## Modify /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf

We’ll also need to set the `apikey` option, which is a secret key to authenticate our account. Our api key can be shown by *td apikey:show*, as long as we have successfully authenticated our account using the ‘td account’ command.:

    :::term
    $ td apikey:show
    3b7118fd3ad7e35bbd3c0e4f607ec7263aa93c30

Let’s set the `apikey` option in our td-agent.conf file. Please replace *YOUR_API_KEY* to your actual apikey string.

    :::term
    # Treasure Data Input and Output
    <source>
      type forward
      port 24224
    </source>
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      apikey YOUR_API_KEY
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
    </match>

Once these lines are in place, we’ll restart our agent.

    :::term
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

We have now enabled td-agent to read, and upload our log data into the cloud via port 24224.

## Use fluent-logger-perl

[fluent-logger-perl](http://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-perl) is a Perl library to post the records to td-agent from a Perl application. At first, please install *Fluent::Logger* library via CPAN.

    :::term
    $ cpan
    cpan[1]> install Fluent::Logger

Then, please initialize and post the records as follows.

#### test.pl

    :::php
    use Fluent::Logger;
    my $logger = Fluent::Logger->new(
        host => '127.0.0.1',
        port => 24224,
        tag_prefix => 'td.test_db',
    );
    $logger->post("test_table", { "entry1" => "value1", "entry2" => 2 });

## Confirm the Import

The posted records are first transferred to the local td-agent. td-agent buffers the records within local disk for a while, and uploads them every 5 minutes.

NOTE: The first argument of post() determines the database name and table name. If you specify 'td.test_db.test_table', the data will be imported into *test_table* table within *test_db* database. Those are automatically created at the upload time.

Rather than waiting 5 minutes, sending SIGUSR1 signal to the agent flushes its buffe,r and it starts uploading immediately.

    :::term
    $ perl test.pl
    $ kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/td-agent/td-agent.pid`

To confirm the data upload, please use *td tables*.

    $ td tables
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | Database   | Table      | Type | Count     |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | test_db    | test_table | log  | 1         |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+

## Production Deployments

### High-Availablability Configurations of td-agent

For highly loaded sites (more than 5 application nodes), we recommend using high availability configuration for td-agent. This improves the data transfer reliability, and also the query performance.
