# Writing Job Results into Tableau Online

Using [Tableau Online](http://www.tableausoftware.com/products/online) with Treasure Data allows users to interactively explore huge amounts of data, and also share the knowledge across multiple people.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Treasure Data
  * An license and its installation of Tableau Online

## One Time Query

Please visit the [query editor](http://console.treasuredata.com/query_forms/new) on the web console, and type in the query. The example query below uses the access log example data set, and calculates the distribution of HTTP method per day.

    :::sql
    # HiveQL
    SELECT
      CAST(TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00") AS TIMESTAMP) AS `Datetime`,
      method AS `Method`,
      COUNT(1) AS `Count`
    FROM
      www_access
    GROUP BY
      TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00"),
      method

NOTE: We're casting Datetime column to TIMESTAMP type from String type, for the convenience in the later stages.


Next, please select `Tableau Server` from `Result Export` section. Then the dialog like below will pop up.

Finally, please fill in name of `Datasource` (TDE filename), `Site` (use EMPTY string for Tableau Online), `Project`, and `Mode`. Please visit these URLs to get a list of projects and sites. Let's use `replace` mode for now.

* Site: `EMPTY String` for Tableau Online
* List of Projects: `https://online.tableausoftware.com/t/<YOUR_SITE_NAME>/projects`

After filling in all the fields, please `Submit` the query. The system will execute the query, create the TDE (Tableau Data Extract) file, and finally upload TDE to Tableau Online.

Please visit your Tableau Online, and click `Data Sources` section at the top left bar. This will show the list of data sources, and your TDE file should exist there.

By clicking `New Workbook`, you can create the charts and dashboard from the browser. Please drag and drop the dimentions & measures from the left nav, to top right nav to create the graphs. Then please click `Save` to store the result.

## Scheduled Query

In the previous section, you have learned how to create the charts by one job. The next action is to periodically refresh the dataset by [Scheduled Jobs](schedule) feature. By using this feature, you can periodically execute the query on Treasure Data, and update TDE file on Tableau Server. The schedules can be specified from the query editor. One thing it's useful is to use [TD_SCHEDULED_TIME()](udfs#tdscheduledtime) UDF, with `append` mode.

The query below will calculate the # of records within last 24 hours, from the time where the query gets executed. By continuously running this scheduled query, you can avoid processing the entire data set every day.

    :::sql
    # HiveQL
    SELECT
      CAST(TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00") AS TIMESTAMP) AS `Datetime`,
      COUNT(1) AS `Cnt`
    FROM
      aaaaa
    GROUP BY
      TD_TIME_FORMAT(time, "yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00")
    WHERE
      TD_TIME_RANGE(time,
        TD_TIME_ADD(TD_SCHEDULED_TIME(), '-1d'),
        TD_SCHEDULED_TIME())
