# Hivemall: Scalable Machine Learning Library

[Hivemall](https://github.com/myui/hivemall) is a scalable machine learning library that runs on Apache Hive. Hivemall is designed to be scalable to the number of training instances as well as the number of training features.

## Supported Algorithms

Hivemall provides machine learning functionality as well as feature engineering functions through UDFs/UDAFs/UDTFs of Hive. 

### Classification

- Perceptron
- Passive Aggressive (PA, PA1, PA2)
- Confidence Weighted (CW)
- Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors (AROW)
- Soft Confidence Weighted (SCW1, SCW2)
- AdaGradRDA (with hinge loss)

### Regression

- Logistic Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent
- AdaGrad / AdaDelta (with logistic loss)
- Passive Aggressive Regression (PA1, PA2)
- AROW regression

### Recommendation

- Matrix Factorization (sgd, adagrad)
  - Example: [Rating prediction by Matrix Factorization](movielens_20m)
- Minhash (LSH with jaccard index)

### k-Nearest Neighbor

- Minhash (LSH with jaccard index)
- b-Bit minhash
- Brute-force search using cosine similarity

### Feature Engineering

- Feature hashing (MurmurHash, SHA1)
- Feature scaling (Min-Max Normalization, Z-Score)
- Feature instances amplifier that reduces iterations on training
- TF-IDF vectorizer
- Bias clause
- Data generator for one-vs-the-rest classifiers
