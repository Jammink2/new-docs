# Tailing Nginx Access Logs

This article explains how to tail Nginx access logs from td-agent, to continuously import the access logs into the cloud.

## Installing td-agent

'td-agent' needs to be installed on your application servers. td-agent is a daemon program dedicated to the streaming upload of any kind of the time-series data. td-agent is developed and maintained by Treasure Data, Inc.

To set up td-agent, please refer to the following articles; we provide deb/rpm packages for Linux systems.

NOTE: td-agent is fully open-sourced under the <a href="http://fluentd.org/">fluentd project</a>. td-agent extends fluentd with custom plugins for Treasure Data.

## Modifying /etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf

Next, please specify your authentication key by setting the `apikey` option. You can view your api key from the [console](https://console.treasuredata.com/users/current). Next, please set the `apikey` option in your td-agent.conf file. 

Note: *YOUR_API_KEY* should be your actual apikey string.

    :::text
    # Tailing the Apache Log
    <source>
      type tail
      path /var/log/nginx/access.log
      pos_file /var/log/td-agent/nginx-access.pos
      tag td.production.access
      format nginx
    </source>
    
    # Treasure Data Input and Output
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      endpoint <%= @env[:api_endpoint] %>
      apikey YOUR_API_KEY
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /var/log/td-agent/buffer/td
      use_ssl true
    </match>

Please restart your agent once these lines are in place.

    :::term
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

td-agent will now keep tailing the log, buffer it (*var/log/td-agent/buffer/td*), and automatically upload it into the cloud.

## Confirming Data Import

Sending a SIGUSR1 signal will flush td-agent's buffer; upload will start immediately.

    :::term
    # generate access logs
    $ curl http://host:port/
    
    # flush the buffer
    $ kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/td-agent/td-agent.pid`

To confirm that your data has been uploaded successfully, issue the `td tables` command as shown below.

    :::term
    $ td tables
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | Database   | Table      | Type | Count     |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+
    | production | access     | log  | 1         |
    +------------+------------+------+-----------+

Please check `/var/log/td-agent.log` if it's not working correctly. `td-agent:td-agent` needs to have a permission to access the logs.

NOTE: <b>td-agent handles log-rotation</b>. td-agent keeps a record of the last position of the log, ensuring that each line is read exactly once even if the td-agent process goes down. However, since the information is kept in a file, the "exactly once" guarantee breaks down if the file becomes corrupted.
