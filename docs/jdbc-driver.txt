# JDBC Driver

This guide covers how to use [JDBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity) (Java Database Connectivity) driver for Treasure Data. By using this driver, you can operate on Treasure Data with a standard JDBC interface.

## Download

You can download the driver itself from here. The driver is still in beta quality, so please report to us if you have any problems.

* 2012/06/04: [td-jdbc-0.1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/td-jdbc/td-jdbc-0.1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar)

NOTE: This driver works only with Treasure Data, doesn't work with other environments like your local Hadoop/Hive cluster.

## Query Execution Internals

Because Treasure Data is a cloud service, the behavior of JDBC driver is slightly different from those for the traditional RDBMs.

#### SELECT Query

If the driver receives SELECT query, it's issued into the cloud. While running the jobs on the cloud, the driver *keeps polling* the job results. This might take several hours, so using background thread is recommended.

#### INSERT Query

If the driver receives INSERT query, the data is first buffered into the local memory. Those are uploaded into the cloud every 5 minutes. Please be careful that the upload doesn't occur in realtime.

## Sample Java Program

Here's a sample Java program, which executes the SELECT query. This counts the number of records within testdb.www_access.

### JDBCSample.java

    :::java
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.sql.Connection;
    import java.sql.DriverManager;
    import java.sql.ResultSet;
    import java.sql.Statement;
    import java.util.Properties;
    import com.treasure_data.jdbc.TestTreasureDataDriver;
    
    public class JDBCSample {
      public static void loadSystemProperties() throws IOException {
        Properties props = System.getProperties();
        props.load(TestTreasureDataDriver.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("treasure-data.properties"));
      }
    
      public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        loadSystemProperties();
        try {
          Class.forName("com.treasure_data.jdbc.TreasureDataDriver");
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
          System.exit(1);
        }
    
        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
          "jdbc:td://api.treasure-data.com/testdb",
          "YOUR_MAIL_ADDRESS_HERE",
          "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE");
        Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
        String sql = "SELECT count(1) FROM www_access";
        System.out.println("Running: " + sql);
        ResultSet res = stmt.executeQuery(sql);
        while (res.next()) {
          System.out.println(String.valueOf(res.getObject(1)));
        }
      }
    }

### treasure-data.properties

    :::text
    td.logger.agentmode=false
    td.api.key=<your API key>
