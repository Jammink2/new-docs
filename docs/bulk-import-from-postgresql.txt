# Bulk Import from PostgreSQL

This article explains how to dump data from PostgreSQL and import them into Treasure Data.

## Install Bulk Loader

First, install the [toolbelt](command-line), which includes bulk loader program, on your computer.

#### Downloads
- [Toolbelt Installer for Windows](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/win)
- [Toolbelt Installer for Mac OS X](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/mac)
- [Toolbelt Installer for Linux](http://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/linux)

After the installation, the `td` command will be installed on your computer. Open up the terminal and type `td` to execute the command. Also, please make sure you have `java` as well. Run `td import:jar_update` to download the up-to-date version of our bulk loader:

    :::terminal
    $ td
    usage: td [options] COMMAND [args]
    $ java
    Usage: java [-options] class [args...]
    $ td import:jar_update
    Installed td-import.jar 0.x.xx into /path/to/.td/java

## Dump

Use `copy` to export a table from PostgreSQL to a CSV file as shown below:

    :::terminal
    COPY users TO '/tmp/data.csv' DELIMITER ','

For more information, please see the [PostgreSQL documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-copy.html).
