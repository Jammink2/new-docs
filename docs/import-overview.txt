# Overview of Data Import

This article explains the different options for importing data into Treasure Data and which choice is approprite for your use case.

## Three Types of Data Import

#### 1) Streaming Import

Importing continuously generated data from running servers. [Treasure Agent](td-agent) is necessary to be installed on the servers, to streamingly collect and upload the data to the cloud.

#### 2) Bulk Import

Importing a large amount of existing data (CSV, TSV, etc) in a reliable way from your servers or PCs. [Bulk Import Tool](bulk-import) needs to be installed on your machine. This method takes into account possible network transfer failure between your side and the cloud, and it has sophisticated retrying mechanism.

#### 3) App / Mobile SDKs

Importing records directly from Web or Mobile applications, using Treasure Data's SDKs. Your application needs to modify your applications to embed [our SDKs](/categories/sdks).
