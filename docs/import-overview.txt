## Three Types of Data Import

Here's a guideline to decide which import mechanism to use.

#### 1) Streaming Import

Importing continuously generated data from running servers. [Treasure Agent](td-agent) is necessary to be installed on the servers, to streamingly collect and upload the data to the cloud.

#### 2) App / Mobile SDKs

Importing records directly from Web or Mobile applications, using Treasure Data's SDKs. Your application needs to modify your applications to embed our SDKs ([JavaScript](/articles/javascript-sdk), [Mobile](/categories/mobile-sdks), [App](/categories/app-sdks) SDKs).

#### 3) Bulk Import

Importing a large amount of existing data (CSV, TSV, etc) in a reliable way from your servers or PCs. [Bulk Import Tool](bulk-import) needs to be installed on your machine. This method takes into account possible network transfer failure between your side and the cloud, and it has sophisticated retrying mechanism.
