## Three Types of Data Import

Here's a guideline to decide which import mechanism to use.

#### 1) Streaming Import

Importing continuously generated data from live servers. [Treasure Agent](td-agent) must be installed on the servers to collect streaming data and upload it to Treasure Data cloud storage.

#### 2) App / Mobile SDKs

Importing records directly from Web or Mobile applications using Treasure Data's SDKs. Your developer must embed our SDKs in your applications ([JavaScript](/articles/javascript-sdk), [Mobile](/categories/mobile-sdks), [App](/categories/app-sdks) SDKs).

#### 3) Bulk Import

Importing a large amount of existing data (CSV, TSV, etc) in a reliable way from your servers or PCs. [Bulk Import Tool](bulk-import) must be installed on your machine. This method takes into account possible network transfer failure between your side and the cloud, and it has a sophisticated retry mechanism.
