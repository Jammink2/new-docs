# Known Limitations

The Hive query engine has some limitations compared to Hive at this stage. We welcome your feedback and will make improvements based on these.

## Division

When two values (of any type) are divided in Hive the result of the division is *always* automatically upgraded to 'double'.<br/>
To obtain an integer result from a division please cast the result of the division to the desired type. For example:

    SELECT
        CAST((column1 / column2) AS bigint) as division
      FROM
        table

NOTE: The Presto engine behaves differently with divisions and does not automatically upgrades the result to double.

## Divide By 0

When the dividend of a division is 0, the result will be a '*NaN*'.

This can commonly happen when the dividing the values of 2 columns and the value of the column used as divided is a 0. For example:

    SELECT
        column1,
        column2,
        column3 / column4 as division
      FROM
        table
